mowgli s brothers

     now rann the kite brings home the night
        that mang the bat sets free  
     the herds are shut in byre and hut
        for loosed till dawn are we 
     this is the hour of pride and power 
        talon and tush and claw 
     oh  hear the call   good hunting all
        that keep the jungle law 
     night song in the jungle

it was seven o clock of a very warm evening in the seeonee hills when
father wolf woke up from his day s rest  scratched himself  yawned  and
spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling
in their tips  mother wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her
four tumbling  squealing cubs  and the moon shone into the mouth of the
cave where they all lived   augrh   said father wolf   it is time to
hunt again   he was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with
a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined   good luck go with you  o
chief of the wolves  and good luck and strong white teeth go with noble
children that they may never forget the hungry in this world  

it was the jackal  tabaqui  the dish licker  and the wolves of india
despise tabaqui because he runs about making mischief  and telling
tales  and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village
rubbish heaps  but they are afraid of him too  because tabaqui  more
than anyone else in the jungle  is apt to go mad  and then he forgets
that he was ever afraid of anyone  and runs through the forest biting
everything in his way  even the tiger runs and hides when little tabaqui
goes mad  for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake
a wild creature  we call it hydrophobia  but they call it dewanee  the
madness  and run 

 enter  then  and look   said father wolf stiffly   but there is no food
here  

 for a wolf  no   said tabaqui   but for so mean a person as myself a
dry bone is a good feast  who are we  the gidur log  the jackal people  
to pick and choose   he scuttled to the back of the cave  where he
found the bone of a buck with some meat on it  and sat cracking the end
merrily 

 all thanks for this good meal   he said  licking his lips   how
beautiful are the noble children  how large are their eyes  and so young
too  indeed  indeed  i might have remembered that the children of kings
are men from the beginning  

now  tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so
unlucky as to compliment children to their faces  it pleased him to see
mother and father wolf look uncomfortable 

tabaqui sat still  rejoicing in the mischief that he had made  and then
he said spitefully 

 shere khan  the big one  has shifted his hunting grounds  he will hunt
among these hills for the next moon  so he has told me  

shere khan was the tiger who lived near the waingunga river  twenty
miles away 

 he has no right   father wolf began angrily   by the law of the jungle
he has no right to change his quarters without due warning  he will
frighten every head of game within ten miles  and i  i have to kill for
two  these days  

 his mother did not call him lungri  the lame one  for nothing   said
mother wolf quietly   he has been lame in one foot from his birth  that
is why he has only killed cattle  now the villagers of the waingunga are
angry with him  and he has come here to make our villagers angry 
they will scour the jungle for him when he is far away  and we and our
children must run when the grass is set alight  indeed  we are very
grateful to shere khan  

 shall i tell him of your gratitude   said tabaqui 

 out   snapped father wolf   out and hunt with thy master  thou hast
done harm enough for one night  

 i go   said tabaqui quietly   ye can hear shere khan below in the
thickets  i might have saved myself the message  

father wolf listened  and below in the valley that ran down to a little
river he heard the dry  angry  snarly  singsong whine of a tiger who has
caught nothing and does not care if all the jungle knows it 

 the fool   said father wolf   to begin a night s work with that noise 
does he think that our buck are like his fat waingunga bullocks  

 h sh  it is neither bullock nor buck he hunts to night   said mother
wolf   it is man  

the whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come
from every quarter of the compass  it was the noise that bewilders
woodcutters and gypsies sleeping in the open  and makes them run
sometimes into the very mouth of the tiger 

 man   said father wolf  showing all his white teeth   faugh  are there
not enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat man  and on
our ground too  

the law of the jungle  which never orders anything without a reason 
forbids every beast to eat man except when he is killing to show his
children how to kill  and then he must hunt outside the hunting grounds
of his pack or tribe  the real reason for this is that man killing
means  sooner or later  the arrival of white men on elephants  with
guns  and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches 
then everybody in the jungle suffers  the reason the beasts give among
themselves is that man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living
things  and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him  they say too  and it is
true  that man eaters become mangy  and lose their teeth 

the purr grew louder  and ended in the full throated  aaarh   of the
tiger s charge 

then there was a howl  an untigerish howl  from shere khan   he has
missed   said mother wolf   what is it  

father wolf ran out a few paces and heard shere khan muttering and
mumbling savagely as he tumbled about in the scrub 

 the fool has had no more sense than to jump at a woodcutter s campfire 
and has burned his feet   said father wolf with a grunt   tabaqui is
with him  

 something is coming uphill   said mother wolf  twitching one ear   get
ready  

the bushes rustled a little in the thicket  and father wolf dropped
with his haunches under him  ready for his leap  then  if you had been
watching  you would have seen the most wonderful thing in the world  the
wolf checked in mid spring  he made his bound before he saw what it was
he was jumping at  and then he tried to stop himself  the result was
that he shot up straight into the air for four or five feet  landing
almost where he left ground 

 man   he snapped   a man s cub  look  

directly in front of him  holding on by a low branch  stood a naked
brown baby who could just walk  as soft and as dimpled a little atom
as ever came to a wolf s cave at night  he looked up into father wolf s
face  and laughed 

 is that a man s cub   said mother wolf   i have never seen one  bring
it here  

a wolf accustomed to moving his own cubs can  if necessary  mouth an egg
without breaking it  and though father wolf s jaws closed right on the
child s back not a tooth even scratched the skin as he laid it down
among the cubs 

 how little  how naked  and  how bold   said mother wolf softly  the
baby was pushing his way between the cubs to get close to the warm hide 
 ahai  he is taking his meal with the others  and so this is a man s
cub  now  was there ever a wolf that could boast of a man s cub among
her children  

 i have heard now and again of such a thing  but never in our pack or in
my time   said father wolf   he is altogether without hair  and i
could kill him with a touch of my foot  but see  he looks up and is not
afraid  

the moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave  for shere khan s
great square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance  tabaqui 
behind him  was squeaking   my lord  my lord  it went in here  

 shere khan does us great honor   said father wolf  but his eyes were
very angry   what does shere khan need  

 my quarry  a man s cub went this way   said shere khan   its parents
have run off  give it to me  

shere khan had jumped at a woodcutter s campfire  as father wolf had
said  and was furious from the pain of his burned feet  but father wolf
knew that the mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger to come in
by  even where he was  shere khan s shoulders and forepaws were cramped
for want of room  as a man s would be if he tried to fight in a barrel 

 the wolves are a free people   said father wolf   they take orders from
the head of the pack  and not from any striped cattle killer  the man s
cub is ours  to kill if we choose  

 ye choose and ye do not choose  what talk is this of choosing  by the
bull that i killed  am i to stand nosing into your dog s den for my fair
dues  it is i  shere khan  who speak  

the tiger s roar filled the cave with thunder  mother wolf shook herself
clear of the cubs and sprang forward  her eyes  like two green moons in
the darkness  facing the blazing eyes of shere khan 

 and it is i  raksha  the demon   who answers  the man s cub is mine 
lungri  mine to me  he shall not be killed  he shall live to run with
the pack and to hunt with the pack  and in the end  look you  hunter of
little naked cubs  frog eater  fish killer  he shall hunt thee  now get
hence  or by the sambhur that i killed  i eat no starved cattle   back
thou goest to thy mother  burned beast of the jungle  lamer than ever
thou camest into the world  go  

father wolf looked on amazed  he had almost forgotten the days when he
won mother wolf in fair fight from five other wolves  when she ran in
the pack and was not called the demon for compliment s sake  shere khan
might have faced father wolf  but he could not stand up against mother
wolf  for he knew that where he was she had all the advantage of the
ground  and would fight to the death  so he backed out of the cave mouth
growling  and when he was clear he shouted 

 each dog barks in his own yard  we will see what the pack will say to
this fostering of man cubs  the cub is mine  and to my teeth he will
come in the end  o bush tailed thieves  

mother wolf threw herself down panting among the cubs  and father wolf
said to her gravely 

 shere khan speaks this much truth  the cub must be shown to the pack 
wilt thou still keep him  mother  

 keep him   she gasped   he came naked  by night  alone and very hungry 
yet he was not afraid  look  he has pushed one of my babes to one side
already  and that lame butcher would have killed him and would have run
off to the waingunga while the villagers here hunted through all our
lairs in revenge  keep him  assuredly i will keep him  lie still  little
frog  o thou mowgli  for mowgli the frog i will call thee  the time will
come when thou wilt hunt shere khan as he has hunted thee  

 but what will our pack say   said father wolf 

the law of the jungle lays down very clearly that any wolf may  when he
marries  withdraw from the pack he belongs to  but as soon as his cubs
are old enough to stand on their feet he must bring them to the pack
council  which is generally held once a month at full moon  in order
that the other wolves may identify them  after that inspection the cubs
are free to run where they please  and until they have killed their
first buck no excuse is accepted if a grown wolf of the pack kills one
of them  the punishment is death where the murderer can be found  and if
you think for a minute you will see that this must be so 

father wolf waited till his cubs could run a little  and then on the
night of the pack meeting took them and mowgli and mother wolf to the
council rock  a hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred
wolves could hide  akela  the great gray lone wolf  who led all the pack
by strength and cunning  lay out at full length on his rock  and
below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and color  from
badger colored veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black
three year olds who thought they could  the lone wolf had led them for a
year now  he had fallen twice into a wolf trap in his youth  and once he
had been beaten and left for dead  so he knew the manners and customs
of men  there was very little talking at the rock  the cubs tumbled over
each other in the center of the circle where their mothers and fathers
sat  and now and again a senior wolf would go quietly up to a cub  look
at him carefully  and return to his place on noiseless feet  sometimes a
mother would push her cub far out into the moonlight to be sure that
he had not been overlooked  akela from his rock would cry   ye know
the law  ye know the law  look well  o wolves   and the anxious mothers
would take up the call   look  look well  o wolves  

at last  and mother wolf s neck bristles lifted as the time came  father
wolf pushed  mowgli the frog   as they called him  into the center 
where he sat laughing and playing with some pebbles that glistened in
the moonlight 

akela never raised his head from his paws  but went on with the
monotonous cry   look well   a muffled roar came up from behind the
rocks  the voice of shere khan crying   the cub is mine  give him to
me  what have the free people to do with a man s cub   akela never even
twitched his ears  all he said was   look well  o wolves  what have
the free people to do with the orders of any save the free people  look
well  

there was a chorus of deep growls  and a young wolf in his fourth year
flung back shere khan s question to akela   what have the free people to
do with a man s cub   now  the law of the jungle lays down that if there
is any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the pack  he
must be spoken for by at least two members of the pack who are not his
father and mother 

 who speaks for this cub   said akela   among the free people who
speaks   there was no answer and mother wolf got ready for what she knew
would be her last fight  if things came to fighting 

then the only other creature who is allowed at the pack council  baloo 
the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the law of the jungle 
old baloo  who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only
nuts and roots and honey  rose upon his hind quarters and grunted 

 the man s cub  the man s cub   he said   i speak for the man s cub 
there is no harm in a man s cub  i have no gift of words  but i speak
the truth  let him run with the pack  and be entered with the others  i
myself will teach him  

 we need yet another   said akela   baloo has spoken  and he is our
teacher for the young cubs  who speaks besides baloo  

a black shadow dropped down into the circle  it was bagheera the black
panther  inky black all over  but with the panther markings showing
up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk  everybody knew
bagheera  and nobody cared to cross his path  for he was as cunning as
tabaqui  as bold as the wild buffalo  and as reckless as the wounded
elephant  but he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree 
and a skin softer than down 

 o akela  and ye the free people   he purred   i have no right in your
assembly  but the law of the jungle says that if there is a doubt which
is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub  the life of that cub may
be bought at a price  and the law does not say who may or may not pay
that price  am i right  

 good  good   said the young wolves  who are always hungry   listen to
bagheera  the cub can be bought for a price  it is the law  

 knowing that i have no right to speak here  i ask your leave  

 speak then   cried twenty voices 

 to kill a naked cub is shame  besides  he may make better sport for you
when he is grown  baloo has spoken in his behalf  now to baloo s word
i will add one bull  and a fat one  newly killed  not half a mile
from here  if ye will accept the man s cub according to the law  is it
difficult  

there was a clamor of scores of voices  saying   what matter  he will
die in the winter rains  he will scorch in the sun  what harm can
a naked frog do us  let him run with the pack  where is the bull 
bagheera  let him be accepted   and then came akela s deep bay  crying 
 look well  look well  o wolves  

mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles  and he did not notice
when the wolves came and looked at him one by one  at last they all went
down the hill for the dead bull  and only akela  bagheera  baloo  and
mowgli s own wolves were left  shere khan roared still in the night  for
he was very angry that mowgli had not been handed over to him 

 ay  roar well   said bagheera  under his whiskers   for the time will
come when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune  or i
know nothing of man  

 it was well done   said akela   men and their cubs are very wise  he
may be a help in time  

 truly  a help in time of need  for none can hope to lead the pack
forever   said bagheera 

akela said nothing  he was thinking of the time that comes to every
leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler
and feebler  till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader
comes up  to be killed in his turn 

 take him away   he said to father wolf   and train him as befits one of
the free people  

and that is how mowgli was entered into the seeonee wolf pack for the
price of a bull and on baloo s good word 

now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years  and only
guess at all the wonderful life that mowgli led among the wolves 
because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books  he
grew up with the cubs  though they  of course  were grown wolves almost
before he was a child  and father wolf taught him his business  and the
meaning of things in the jungle  till every rustle in the grass  every
breath of the warm night air  every note of the owls above his head 
every scratch of a bat s claws as it roosted for a while in a tree  and
every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much
to him as the work of his office means to a business man  when he was
not learning he sat out in the sun and slept  and ate and went to sleep
again  when he felt dirty or hot he swam in the forest pools  and
when he wanted honey  baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as
pleasant to eat as raw meat  he climbed up for it  and that bagheera
showed him how to do  bagheera would lie out on a branch and call   come
along  little brother   and at first mowgli would cling like the sloth 
but afterward he would fling himself through the branches almost as
boldly as the gray ape  he took his place at the council rock  too 
when the pack met  and there he discovered that if he stared hard at any
wolf  the wolf would be forced to drop his eyes  and so he used to stare
for fun  at other times he would pick the long thorns out of the pads
of his friends  for wolves suffer terribly from thorns and burs in their
coats  he would go down the hillside into the cultivated lands by night 
and look very curiously at the villagers in their huts  but he had a
mistrust of men because bagheera showed him a square box with a drop
gate so cunningly hidden in the jungle that he nearly walked into it 
and told him that it was a trap  he loved better than anything else to
go with bagheera into the dark warm heart of the forest  to sleep all
through the drowsy day  and at night see how bagheera did his
killing  bagheera killed right and left as he felt hungry  and so did
mowgli  with one exception  as soon as he was old enough to understand
things  bagheera told him that he must never touch cattle because he had
been bought into the pack at the price of a bull s life   all the jungle
is thine   said bagheera   and thou canst kill everything that thou art
strong enough to kill  but for the sake of the bull that bought thee
thou must never kill or eat any cattle young or old  that is the law of
the jungle   mowgli obeyed faithfully 

and he grew and grew strong as a boy must grow who does not know that
he is learning any lessons  and who has nothing in the world to think of
except things to eat 

mother wolf told him once or twice that shere khan was not a creature
to be trusted  and that some day he must kill shere khan  but though a
young wolf would have remembered that advice every hour  mowgli forgot
it because he was only a boy  though he would have called himself a wolf
if he had been able to speak in any human tongue 

shere khan was always crossing his path in the jungle  for as akela grew
older and feebler the lame tiger had come to be great friends with the
younger wolves of the pack  who followed him for scraps  a thing akela
would never have allowed if he had dared to push his authority to the
proper bounds  then shere khan would flatter them and wonder that such
fine young hunters were content to be led by a dying wolf and a man s
cub   they tell me   shere khan would say   that at council ye dare
not look him between the eyes   and the young wolves would growl and
bristle 

bagheera  who had eyes and ears everywhere  knew something of this  and
once or twice he told mowgli in so many words that shere khan would kill
him some day  mowgli would laugh and answer   i have the pack and i have
thee  and baloo  though he is so lazy  might strike a blow or two for my
sake  why should i be afraid  

it was one very warm day that a new notion came to bagheera  born of
something that he had heard  perhaps ikki the porcupine had told him 
but he said to mowgli when they were deep in the jungle  as the boy lay
with his head on bagheera s beautiful black skin   little brother  how
often have i told thee that shere khan is thy enemy  

 as many times as there are nuts on that palm   said mowgli  who 
naturally  could not count   what of it  i am sleepy  bagheera  and
shere khan is all long tail and loud talk  like mao  the peacock  

 but this is no time for sleeping  baloo knows it  i know it  the pack
know it  and even the foolish  foolish deer know  tabaqui has told thee
too  

 ho  ho   said mowgli   tabaqui came to me not long ago with some rude
talk that i was a naked man s cub and not fit to dig pig nuts  but i
caught tabaqui by the tail and swung him twice against a palm tree to
teach him better manners  

 that was foolishness  for though tabaqui is a mischief maker  he would
have told thee of something that concerned thee closely  open those
eyes  little brother  shere khan dare not kill thee in the jungle  but
remember  akela is very old  and soon the day comes when he cannot kill
his buck  and then he will be leader no more  many of the wolves that
looked thee over when thou wast brought to the council first are old
too  and the young wolves believe  as shere khan has taught them  that
a man cub has no place with the pack  in a little time thou wilt be a
man  

 and what is a man that he should not run with his brothers   said
mowgli   i was born in the jungle  i have obeyed the law of the jungle 
and there is no wolf of ours from whose paws i have not pulled a thorn 
surely they are my brothers  

bagheera stretched himself at full length and half shut his eyes 
 little brother   said he   feel under my jaw  

mowgli put up his strong brown hand  and just under bagheera s silky
chin  where the giant rolling muscles were all hid by the glossy hair 
he came upon a little bald spot 

 there is no one in the jungle that knows that i  bagheera  carry that
mark  the mark of the collar  and yet  little brother  i was born among
men  and it was among men that my mother died  in the cages of the
king s palace at oodeypore  it was because of this that i paid the price
for thee at the council when thou wast a little naked cub  yes  i too
was born among men  i had never seen the jungle  they fed me behind
bars from an iron pan till one night i felt that i was bagheera  the
panther  and no man s plaything  and i broke the silly lock with one
blow of my paw and came away  and because i had learned the ways of men 
i became more terrible in the jungle than shere khan  is it not so  

 yes   said mowgli   all the jungle fear bagheera  all except mowgli  

 oh  thou art a man s cub   said the black panther very tenderly   and
even as i returned to my jungle  so thou must go back to men at last  to
the men who are thy brothers  if thou art not killed in the council  

 but why  but why should any wish to kill me   said mowgli 

 look at me   said bagheera  and mowgli looked at him steadily between
the eyes  the big panther turned his head away in half a minute 

 that is why   he said  shifting his paw on the leaves   not even i can
look thee between the eyes  and i was born among men  and i love thee 
little brother  the others they hate thee because their eyes cannot meet
thine  because thou art wise  because thou hast pulled out thorns from
their feet  because thou art a man  

 i did not know these things   said mowgli sullenly  and he frowned
under his heavy black eyebrows 

 what is the law of the jungle  strike first and then give tongue  by
thy very carelessness they know that thou art a man  but be wise  it is
in my heart that when akela misses his next kill  and at each hunt
it costs him more to pin the buck  the pack will turn against him and
against thee  they will hold a jungle council at the rock  and then  and
then  i have it   said bagheera  leaping up   go thou down quickly to
the men s huts in the valley  and take some of the red flower which they
grow there  so that when the time comes thou mayest have even a stronger
friend than i or baloo or those of the pack that love thee  get the red
flower  

by red flower bagheera meant fire  only no creature in the jungle will
call fire by its proper name  every beast lives in deadly fear of it 
and invents a hundred ways of describing it 

 the red flower   said mowgli   that grows outside their huts in the
twilight  i will get some  

 there speaks the man s cub   said bagheera proudly   remember that it
grows in little pots  get one swiftly  and keep it by thee for time of
need  

 good   said mowgli   i go  but art thou sure  o my bagheera   he
slipped his arm around the splendid neck and looked deep into the big
eyes   art thou sure that all this is shere khan s doing  

 by the broken lock that freed me  i am sure  little brother  

 then  by the bull that bought me  i will pay shere khan full tale for
this  and it may be a little over   said mowgli  and he bounded away 

 that is a man  that is all a man   said bagheera to himself  lying down
again   oh  shere khan  never was a blacker hunting than that frog hunt
of thine ten years ago  

mowgli was far and far through the forest  running hard  and his heart
was hot in him  he came to the cave as the evening mist rose  and drew
breath  and looked down the valley  the cubs were out  but mother
wolf  at the back of the cave  knew by his breathing that something was
troubling her frog 

 what is it  son   she said 

 some bat s chatter of shere khan   he called back   i hunt among the
plowed fields tonight   and he plunged downward through the bushes  to
the stream at the bottom of the valley  there he checked  for he heard
the yell of the pack hunting  heard the bellow of a hunted sambhur 
and the snort as the buck turned at bay  then there were wicked  bitter
howls from the young wolves   akela  akela  let the lone wolf show his
strength  room for the leader of the pack  spring  akela  

the lone wolf must have sprung and missed his hold  for mowgli heard the
snap of his teeth and then a yelp as the sambhur knocked him over with
his forefoot 

he did not wait for anything more  but dashed on  and the yells grew
fainter behind him as he ran into the croplands where the villagers
lived 

 bagheera spoke truth   he panted  as he nestled down in some cattle
fodder by the window of a hut   to morrow is one day both for akela and
for me  

then he pressed his face close to the window and watched the fire on
the hearth  he saw the husbandman s wife get up and feed it in the night
with black lumps  and when the morning came and the mists were all white
and cold  he saw the man s child pick up a wicker pot plastered inside
with earth  fill it with lumps of red hot charcoal  put it under his
blanket  and go out to tend the cows in the byre 

 is that all   said mowgli   if a cub can do it  there is nothing to
fear   so he strode round the corner and met the boy  took the pot from
his hand  and disappeared into the mist while the boy howled with fear 

 they are very like me   said mowgli  blowing into the pot as he had
seen the woman do   this thing will die if i do not give it things to
eat   and he dropped twigs and dried bark on the red stuff  halfway up
the hill he met bagheera with the morning dew shining like moonstones on
his coat 

 akela has missed   said the panther   they would have killed him last
night  but they needed thee also  they were looking for thee on the
hill  

 i was among the plowed lands  i am ready  see   mowgli held up the
fire pot 

 good  now  i have seen men thrust a dry branch into that stuff  and
presently the red flower blossomed at the end of it  art thou not
afraid  

 no  why should i fear  i remember now  if it is not a dream  how 
before i was a wolf  i lay beside the red flower  and it was warm and
pleasant  

all that day mowgli sat in the cave tending his fire pot and dipping
dry branches into it to see how they looked  he found a branch that
satisfied him  and in the evening when tabaqui came to the cave and told
him rudely enough that he was wanted at the council rock  he laughed
till tabaqui ran away  then mowgli went to the council  still laughing 

akela the lone wolf lay by the side of his rock as a sign that the
leadership of the pack was open  and shere khan with his following of
scrap fed wolves walked to and fro openly being flattered  bagheera lay
close to mowgli  and the fire pot was between mowgli s knees  when they
were all gathered together  shere khan began to speak  a thing he would
never have dared to do when akela was in his prime 

 he has no right   whispered bagheera   say so  he is a dog s son  he
will be frightened  

mowgli sprang to his feet   free people   he cried   does shere khan
lead the pack  what has a tiger to do with our leadership  

 seeing that the leadership is yet open  and being asked to speak   
shere khan began 

 by whom   said mowgli   are we all jackals  to fawn on this cattle
butcher  the leadership of the pack is with the pack alone  

there were yells of  silence  thou man s cub    let him speak  he has
kept our law   and at last the seniors of the pack thundered   let the
dead wolf speak   when a leader of the pack has missed his kill  he is
called the dead wolf as long as he lives  which is not long 

akela raised his old head wearily   

 free people  and ye too  jackals of shere khan  for twelve seasons i
have led ye to and from the kill  and in all that time not one has been
trapped or maimed  now i have missed my kill  ye know how that plot
was made  ye know how ye brought me up to an untried buck to make my
weakness known  it was cleverly done  your right is to kill me here on
the council rock  now  therefore  i ask  who comes to make an end of the
lone wolf  for it is my right  by the law of the jungle  that ye come
one by one  

there was a long hush  for no single wolf cared to fight akela to
the death  then shere khan roared   bah  what have we to do with this
toothless fool  he is doomed to die  it is the man cub who has lived too
long  free people  he was my meat from the first  give him to me  i
am weary of this man wolf folly  he has troubled the jungle for ten
seasons  give me the man cub  or i will hunt here always  and not give
you one bone  he is a man  a man s child  and from the marrow of my
bones i hate him  

then more than half the pack yelled   a man  a man  what has a man to do
with us  let him go to his own place  

 and turn all the people of the villages against us   clamored shere
khan   no  give him to me  he is a man  and none of us can look him
between the eyes  

akela lifted his head again and said   he has eaten our food  he has
slept with us  he has driven game for us  he has broken no word of the
law of the jungle  

 also  i paid for him with a bull when he was accepted  the worth of a
bull is little  but bagheera s honor is something that he will perhaps
fight for   said bagheera in his gentlest voice 

 a bull paid ten years ago   the pack snarled   what do we care for
bones ten years old  

 or for a pledge   said bagheera  his white teeth bared under his lip 
 well are ye called the free people  

 no man s cub can run with the people of the jungle   howled shere khan 
 give him to me  

 he is our brother in all but blood   akela went on   and ye would kill
him here  in truth  i have lived too long  some of ye are eaters of
cattle  and of others i have heard that  under shere khan s teaching 
ye go by dark night and snatch children from the villager s doorstep 
therefore i know ye to be cowards  and it is to cowards i speak  it is
certain that i must die  and my life is of no worth  or i would offer
that in the man cub s place  but for the sake of the honor of
the pack   a little matter that by being without a leader ye have
forgotten   i promise that if ye let the man cub go to his own place  i
will not  when my time comes to die  bare one tooth against ye  i will
die without fighting  that will at least save the pack three lives 
more i cannot do  but if ye will  i can save ye the shame that comes of
killing a brother against whom there is no fault  a brother spoken for
and bought into the pack according to the law of the jungle  

 he is a man  a man  a man   snarled the pack  and most of the wolves
began to gather round shere khan  whose tail was beginning to switch 

 now the business is in thy hands   said bagheera to mowgli   we can do
no more except fight  

mowgli stood upright  the fire pot in his hands  then he stretched out
his arms  and yawned in the face of the council  but he was furious with
rage and sorrow  for  wolflike  the wolves had never told him how they
hated him   listen you   he cried   there is no need for this dog s
jabber  ye have told me so often tonight that i am a man  and indeed i
would have been a wolf with you to my life s end  that i feel your words
are true  so i do not call ye my brothers any more  but sag  dogs   as
a man should  what ye will do  and what ye will not do  is not yours
to say  that matter is with me  and that we may see the matter more
plainly  i  the man  have brought here a little of the red flower which
ye  dogs  fear  

he flung the fire pot on the ground  and some of the red coals lit
a tuft of dried moss that flared up  as all the council drew back in
terror before the leaping flames 

mowgli thrust his dead branch into the fire till the twigs lit and
crackled  and whirled it above his head among the cowering wolves 

 thou art the master   said bagheera in an undertone   save akela from
the death  he was ever thy friend  

akela  the grim old wolf who had never asked for mercy in his life  gave
one piteous look at mowgli as the boy stood all naked  his long black
hair tossing over his shoulders in the light of the blazing branch that
made the shadows jump and quiver 

 good   said mowgli  staring round slowly   i see that ye are dogs  i go
from you to my own people  if they be my own people  the jungle is shut
to me  and i must forget your talk and your companionship  but i will be
more merciful than ye are  because i was all but your brother in blood 
i promise that when i am a man among men i will not betray ye to men as
ye have betrayed me   he kicked the fire with his foot  and the sparks
flew up   there shall be no war between any of us in the pack  but here
is a debt to pay before i go   he strode forward to where shere khan sat
blinking stupidly at the flames  and caught him by the tuft on his chin 
bagheera followed in case of accidents   up  dog   mowgli cried   up 
when a man speaks  or i will set that coat ablaze  

shere khan s ears lay flat back on his head  and he shut his eyes  for
the blazing branch was very near 

 this cattle killer said he would kill me in the council because he had
not killed me when i was a cub  thus and thus  then  do we beat dogs
when we are men  stir a whisker  lungri  and i ram the red flower down
thy gullet   he beat shere khan over the head with the branch  and the
tiger whimpered and whined in an agony of fear 

 pah  singed jungle cat  go now  but remember when next i come to the
council rock  as a man should come  it will be with shere khan s hide
on my head  for the rest  akela goes free to live as he pleases  ye will
not kill him  because that is not my will  nor do i think that ye
will sit here any longer  lolling out your tongues as though ye were
somebodies  instead of dogs whom i drive out  thus  go   the fire was
burning furiously at the end of the branch  and mowgli struck right
and left round the circle  and the wolves ran howling with the sparks
burning their fur  at last there were only akela  bagheera  and perhaps
ten wolves that had taken mowgli s part  then something began to hurt
mowgli inside him  as he had never been hurt in his life before  and he
caught his breath and sobbed  and the tears ran down his face 

 what is it  what is it   he said   i do not wish to leave the jungle 
and i do not know what this is  am i dying  bagheera  

 no  little brother  that is only tears such as men use   said bagheera 
 now i know thou art a man  and a man s cub no longer  the jungle is
shut indeed to thee henceforward  let them fall  mowgli  they are only
tears   so mowgli sat and cried as though his heart would break  and he
had never cried in all his life before 

 now   he said   i will go to men  but first i must say farewell to my
mother   and he went to the cave where she lived with father wolf  and
he cried on her coat  while the four cubs howled miserably 

 ye will not forget me   said mowgli 

 never while we can follow a trail   said the cubs   come to the foot of
the hill when thou art a man  and we will talk to thee  and we will come
into the croplands to play with thee by night  

 come soon   said father wolf   oh  wise little frog  come again soon 
for we be old  thy mother and i  

 come soon   said mother wolf   little naked son of mine  for  listen 
child of man  i loved thee more than ever i loved my cubs  

 i will surely come   said mowgli   and when i come it will be to lay
out shere khan s hide upon the council rock  do not forget me  tell them
in the jungle never to forget me  

the dawn was beginning to break when mowgli went down the hillside
alone  to meet those mysterious things that are called men 




hunting song of the seeonee pack

     as the dawn was breaking the sambhur belled
        once  twice and again 
     and a doe leaped up  and a doe leaped up
     from the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup 
     this i  scouting alone  beheld 
        once  twice and again 

     as the dawn was breaking the sambhur belled
        once  twice and again 
     and a wolf stole back  and a wolf stole back
     to carry the word to the waiting pack 
     and we sought and we found and we bayed on his track
        once  twice and again 

     as the dawn was breaking the wolf pack yelled
        once  twice and again 
     feet in the jungle that leave no mark 

     eyes that can see in the dark  the dark 
     tongue  give tongue to it   hark   o hark 
        once  twice and again 




kaa s hunting

     his spots are the joy of the leopard  his horns are the
        buffalo s pride 
     be clean  for the strength of the hunter is known by the
        gloss of his hide 
     if ye find that the bullock can toss you  or the heavy browed
        sambhur can gore 
     ye need not stop work to inform us  we knew it ten seasons
        before 
     oppress not the cubs of the stranger  but hail them as sister
        and brother 
     for though they are little and fubsy  it may be the bear is
        their mother 
      there is none like to me   says the cub in the pride of his
        earliest kill 
     but the jungle is large and the cub he is small   let him
        think and be still 
                                 maxims of baloo


all that is told here happened some time before mowgli was turned out of
the seeonee wolf pack  or revenged himself on shere khan the tiger  it
was in the days when baloo was teaching him the law of the jungle  the
big  serious  old brown bear was delighted to have so quick a pupil 
for the young wolves will only learn as much of the law of the jungle
as applies to their own pack and tribe  and run away as soon as they can
repeat the hunting verse   feet that make no noise  eyes that can see in
the dark  ears that can hear the winds in their lairs  and sharp white
teeth  all these things are the marks of our brothers except tabaqui the
jackal and the hyaena whom we hate   but mowgli  as a man cub  had to
learn a great deal more than this  sometimes bagheera the black panther
would come lounging through the jungle to see how his pet was getting
on  and would purr with his head against a tree while mowgli recited the
day s lesson to baloo  the boy could climb almost as well as he could
swim  and swim almost as well as he could run  so baloo  the teacher of
the law  taught him the wood and water laws  how to tell a rotten branch
from a sound one  how to speak politely to the wild bees when he came
upon a hive of them fifty feet above ground  what to say to mang the
bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday  and how to warn the
water snakes in the pools before he splashed down among them  none of
the jungle people like being disturbed  and all are very ready to fly at
an intruder  then  too  mowgli was taught the strangers  hunting call 
which must be repeated aloud till it is answered  whenever one of the
jungle people hunts outside his own grounds  it means  translated   give
me leave to hunt here because i am hungry   and the answer is   hunt
then for food  but not for pleasure  

all this will show you how much mowgli had to learn by heart  and he
grew very tired of saying the same thing over a hundred times  but  as
baloo said to bagheera  one day when mowgli had been cuffed and run off
in a temper   a man s cub is a man s cub  and he must learn all the law
of the jungle  

 but think how small he is   said the black panther  who would have
spoiled mowgli if he had had his own way   how can his little head carry
all thy long talk  

 is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed  no  that is
why i teach him these things  and that is why i hit him  very softly 
when he forgets  

 softly  what dost thou know of softness  old iron feet   bagheera
grunted   his face is all bruised today by thy  softness  ugh  

 better he should be bruised from head to foot by me who love him than
that he should come to harm through ignorance   baloo answered very
earnestly   i am now teaching him the master words of the jungle that
shall protect him with the birds and the snake people  and all that hunt
on four feet  except his own pack  he can now claim protection  if he
will only remember the words  from all in the jungle  is not that worth
a little beating  

 well  look to it then that thou dost not kill the man cub  he is no
tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon  but what are those master
words  i am more likely to give help than to ask it   bagheera stretched
out one paw and admired the steel blue  ripping chisel talons at the end
of it   still i should like to know  

 i will call mowgli and he shall say them  if he will  come  little
brother  

 my head is ringing like a bee tree   said a sullen little voice over
their heads  and mowgli slid down a tree trunk very angry and indignant 
adding as he reached the ground   i come for bagheera and not for thee 
fat old baloo  

 that is all one to me   said baloo  though he was hurt and grieved 
 tell bagheera  then  the master words of the jungle that i have taught
thee this day  

 master words for which people   said mowgli  delighted to show off 
 the jungle has many tongues  i know them all  

 a little thou knowest  but not much  see  o bagheera  they never thank
their teacher  not one small wolfling has ever come back to thank
old baloo for his teachings  say the word for the hunting people 
then  great scholar  

 we be of one blood  ye and i   said mowgli  giving the words the bear
accent which all the hunting people use 

 good  now for the birds  

mowgli repeated  with the kite s whistle at the end of the sentence 

 now for the snake people   said bagheera 

the answer was a perfectly indescribable hiss  and mowgli kicked up his
feet behind  clapped his hands together to applaud himself  and jumped
on to bagheera s back  where he sat sideways  drumming with his heels on
the glossy skin and making the worst faces he could think of at baloo 

 there  there  that was worth a little bruise   said the brown bear
tenderly   some day thou wilt remember me   then he turned aside to
tell bagheera how he had begged the master words from hathi the wild
elephant  who knows all about these things  and how hathi had taken
mowgli down to a pool to get the snake word from a water snake  because
baloo could not pronounce it  and how mowgli was now reasonably safe
against all accidents in the jungle  because neither snake  bird  nor
beast would hurt him 

 no one then is to be feared   baloo wound up  patting his big furry
stomach with pride 

 except his own tribe   said bagheera  under his breath  and then aloud
to mowgli   have a care for my ribs  little brother  what is all this
dancing up and down  

mowgli had been trying to make himself heard by pulling at bagheera s
shoulder fur and kicking hard  when the two listened to him he was
shouting at the top of his voice   and so i shall have a tribe of my
own  and lead them through the branches all day long  

 what is this new folly  little dreamer of dreams   said bagheera 

 yes  and throw branches and dirt at old baloo   mowgli went on   they
have promised me this  ah  

 whoof   baloo s big paw scooped mowgli off bagheera s back  and as the
boy lay between the big fore paws he could see the bear was angry 

 mowgli   said baloo   thou hast been talking with the bandar log  the
monkey people  

mowgli looked at bagheera to see if the panther was angry too  and
bagheera s eyes were as hard as jade stones 

 thou hast been with the monkey people  the gray apes  the people
without a law  the eaters of everything  that is great shame  

 when baloo hurt my head   said mowgli  he was still on his back    i
went away  and the gray apes came down from the trees and had pity on
me  no one else cared   he snuffled a little 

 the pity of the monkey people   baloo snorted   the stillness of the
mountain stream  the cool of the summer sun  and then  man cub  

 and then  and then  they gave me nuts and pleasant things to eat  and
they  they carried me in their arms up to the top of the trees and said
i was their blood brother except that i had no tail  and should be their
leader some day  

 they have no leader   said bagheera   they lie  they have always lied  

 they were very kind and bade me come again  why have i never been taken
among the monkey people  they stand on their feet as i do  they do
not hit me with their hard paws  they play all day  let me get up  bad
baloo  let me up  i will play with them again  

 listen  man cub   said the bear  and his voice rumbled like thunder on
a hot night   i have taught thee all the law of the jungle for all the
peoples of the jungle  except the monkey folk who live in the trees 
they have no law  they are outcasts  they have no speech of their own 
but use the stolen words which they overhear when they listen  and peep 
and wait up above in the branches  their way is not our way  they are
without leaders  they have no remembrance  they boast and chatter and
pretend that they are a great people about to do great affairs in the
jungle  but the falling of a nut turns their minds to laughter and all
is forgotten  we of the jungle have no dealings with them  we do not
drink where the monkeys drink  we do not go where the monkeys go  we do
not hunt where they hunt  we do not die where they die  hast thou ever
heard me speak of the bandar log till today  

 no   said mowgli in a whisper  for the forest was very still now baloo
had finished 

 the jungle people put them out of their mouths and out of their minds 
they are very many  evil  dirty  shameless  and they desire  if they
have any fixed desire  to be noticed by the jungle people  but we do not
notice them even when they throw nuts and filth on our heads  

he had hardly spoken when a shower of nuts and twigs spattered down
through the branches  and they could hear coughings and howlings and
angry jumpings high up in the air among the thin branches 

 the monkey people are forbidden   said baloo   forbidden to the
jungle people  remember  

 forbidden   said bagheera   but i still think baloo should have warned
thee against them  

 i  i  how was i to guess he would play with such dirt  the monkey
people  faugh  

a fresh shower came down on their heads and the two trotted away  taking
mowgli with them  what baloo had said about the monkeys was perfectly
true  they belonged to the tree tops  and as beasts very seldom look
up  there was no occasion for the monkeys and the jungle people to cross
each other s path  but whenever they found a sick wolf  or a wounded
tiger  or bear  the monkeys would torment him  and would throw sticks
and nuts at any beast for fun and in the hope of being noticed  then
they would howl and shriek senseless songs  and invite the jungle people
to climb up their trees and fight them  or would start furious battles
over nothing among themselves  and leave the dead monkeys where the
jungle people could see them  they were always just going to have a
leader  and laws and customs of their own  but they never did  because
their memories would not hold over from day to day  and so they
compromised things by making up a saying   what the bandar log think now
the jungle will think later   and that comforted them a great deal  none
of the beasts could reach them  but on the other hand none of the beasts
would notice them  and that was why they were so pleased when mowgli
came to play with them  and they heard how angry baloo was 

they never meant to do any more  the bandar log never mean anything at
all  but one of them invented what seemed to him a brilliant idea  and
he told all the others that mowgli would be a useful person to keep in
the tribe  because he could weave sticks together for protection from
the wind  so  if they caught him  they could make him teach them 
of course mowgli  as a woodcutter s child  inherited all sorts of
instincts  and used to make little huts of fallen branches without
thinking how he came to do it  the monkey people  watching in the trees 
considered his play most wonderful  this time  they said  they were
really going to have a leader and become the wisest people in the
jungle  so wise that everyone else would notice and envy them  therefore
they followed baloo and bagheera and mowgli through the jungle very
quietly till it was time for the midday nap  and mowgli  who was
very much ashamed of himself  slept between the panther and the bear 
resolving to have no more to do with the monkey people 

the next thing he remembered was feeling hands on his legs and
arms  hard  strong  little hands  and then a swash of branches in his
face  and then he was staring down through the swaying boughs as baloo
woke the jungle with his deep cries and bagheera bounded up the trunk
with every tooth bared  the bandar log howled with triumph and scuffled
away to the upper branches where bagheera dared not follow  shouting 
 he has noticed us  bagheera has noticed us  all the jungle people
admire us for our skill and our cunning   then they began their flight 
and the flight of the monkey people through tree land is one of
the things nobody can describe  they have their regular roads and
crossroads  up hills and down hills  all laid out from fifty to seventy
or a hundred feet above ground  and by these they can travel even at
night if necessary  two of the strongest monkeys caught mowgli under
the arms and swung off with him through the treetops  twenty feet at a
bound  had they been alone they could have gone twice as fast  but the
boy s weight held them back  sick and giddy as mowgli was he could not
help enjoying the wild rush  though the glimpses of earth far down below
frightened him  and the terrible check and jerk at the end of the swing
over nothing but empty air brought his heart between his teeth  his
escort would rush him up a tree till he felt the thinnest topmost
branches crackle and bend under them  and then with a cough and a whoop
would fling themselves into the air outward and downward  and bring
up  hanging by their hands or their feet to the lower limbs of the next
tree  sometimes he could see for miles and miles across the still green
jungle  as a man on the top of a mast can see for miles across the sea 
and then the branches and leaves would lash him across the face  and he
and his two guards would be almost down to earth again  so  bounding and
crashing and whooping and yelling  the whole tribe of bandar log swept
along the tree roads with mowgli their prisoner 

for a time he was afraid of being dropped  then he grew angry but knew
better than to struggle  and then he began to think  the first thing was
to send back word to baloo and bagheera  for  at the pace the monkeys
were going  he knew his friends would be left far behind  it was useless
to look down  for he could only see the topsides of the branches  so he
stared upward and saw  far away in the blue  rann the kite balancing
and wheeling as he kept watch over the jungle waiting for things to die 
rann saw that the monkeys were carrying something  and dropped a
few hundred yards to find out whether their load was good to eat  he
whistled with surprise when he saw mowgli being dragged up to a treetop
and heard him give the kite call for   we be of one blood  thou and i  
the waves of the branches closed over the boy  but rann balanced away to
the next tree in time to see the little brown face come up again   mark
my trail   mowgli shouted   tell baloo of the seeonee pack and bagheera
of the council rock  

 in whose name  brother   rann had never seen mowgli before  though of
course he had heard of him 

 mowgli  the frog  man cub they call me  mark my trail  

the last words were shrieked as he was being swung through the air  but
rann nodded and rose up till he looked no bigger than a speck of dust 
and there he hung  watching with his telescope eyes the swaying of the
treetops as mowgli s escort whirled along 

 they never go far   he said with a chuckle   they never do what they
set out to do  always pecking at new things are the bandar log  this
time  if i have any eye sight  they have pecked down trouble for
themselves  for baloo is no fledgling and bagheera can  as i know  kill
more than goats  

so he rocked on his wings  his feet gathered up under him  and waited 

meantime  baloo and bagheera were furious with rage and grief  bagheera
climbed as he had never climbed before  but the thin branches broke
beneath his weight  and he slipped down  his claws full of bark 

 why didst thou not warn the man cub   he roared to poor baloo  who had
set off at a clumsy trot in the hope of overtaking the monkeys   what
was the use of half slaying him with blows if thou didst not warn him  

 haste  o haste  we  we may catch them yet   baloo panted 

 at that speed  it would not tire a wounded cow  teacher of the
law  cub beater  a mile of that rolling to and fro would burst thee
open  sit still and think  make a plan  this is no time for chasing 
they may drop him if we follow too close  

 arrula  whoo  they may have dropped him already  being tired of
carrying him  who can trust the bandar log  put dead bats on my head 
give me black bones to eat  roll me into the hives of the wild bees
that i may be stung to death  and bury me with the hyaena  for i am most
miserable of bears  arulala  wahooa  o mowgli  mowgli  why did i not
warn thee against the monkey folk instead of breaking thy head  now
perhaps i may have knocked the day s lesson out of his mind  and he will
be alone in the jungle without the master words  

baloo clasped his paws over his ears and rolled to and fro moaning 

 at least he gave me all the words correctly a little time ago   said
bagheera impatiently   baloo  thou hast neither memory nor respect  what
would the jungle think if i  the black panther  curled myself up like
ikki the porcupine  and howled  

 what do i care what the jungle thinks  he may be dead by now  

 unless and until they drop him from the branches in sport  or kill him
out of idleness  i have no fear for the man cub  he is wise and well
taught  and above all he has the eyes that make the jungle people
afraid  but  and it is a great evil  he is in the power of the
bandar log  and they  because they live in trees  have no fear of any of
our people   bagheera licked one forepaw thoughtfully 

 fool that i am  oh  fat  brown  root digging fool that i am   said
baloo  uncoiling himself with a jerk   it is true what hathi the wild
elephant says  `to each his own fear   and they  the bandar log  fear
kaa the rock snake  he can climb as well as they can  he steals the
young monkeys in the night  the whisper of his name makes their wicked
tails cold  let us go to kaa  

 what will he do for us  he is not of our tribe  being footless  and
with most evil eyes   said bagheera 

 he is very old and very cunning  above all  he is always hungry   said
baloo hopefully   promise him many goats  

 he sleeps for a full month after he has once eaten  he may be asleep
now  and even were he awake what if he would rather kill his own goats  
bagheera  who did not know much about kaa  was naturally suspicious 

 then in that case  thou and i together  old hunter  might make him see
reason   here baloo rubbed his faded brown shoulder against the panther 
and they went off to look for kaa the rock python 

they found him stretched out on a warm ledge in the afternoon sun 
admiring his beautiful new coat  for he had been in retirement for the
last ten days changing his skin  and now he was very splendid  darting
his big blunt nosed head along the ground  and twisting the thirty feet
of his body into fantastic knots and curves  and licking his lips as he
thought of his dinner to come 

 he has not eaten   said baloo  with a grunt of relief  as soon as
he saw the beautifully mottled brown and yellow jacket   be careful 
bagheera  he is always a little blind after he has changed his skin  and
very quick to strike  

kaa was not a poison snake  in fact he rather despised the poison snakes
as cowards  but his strength lay in his hug  and when he had once
lapped his huge coils round anybody there was no more to be said   good
hunting   cried baloo  sitting up on his haunches  like all snakes of
his breed kaa was rather deaf  and did not hear the call at first  then
he curled up ready for any accident  his head lowered 

 good hunting for us all   he answered   oho  baloo  what dost thou do
here  good hunting  bagheera  one of us at least needs food  is there
any news of game afoot  a doe now  or even a young buck  i am as empty
as a dried well  

 we are hunting   said baloo carelessly  he knew that you must not hurry
kaa  he is too big 

 give me permission to come with you   said kaa   a blow more or less is
nothing to thee  bagheera or baloo  but i  i have to wait and wait for
days in a wood path and climb half a night on the mere chance of a
young ape  psshaw  the branches are not what they were when i was young 
rotten twigs and dry boughs are they all  

 maybe thy great weight has something to do with the matter   said
baloo 

 i am a fair length  a fair length   said kaa with a little pride   but
for all that  it is the fault of this new grown timber  i came very
near to falling on my last hunt  very near indeed  and the noise of my
slipping  for my tail was not tight wrapped around the tree  waked the
bandar log  and they called me most evil names  

 footless  yellow earth worm   said bagheera under his whiskers  as
though he were trying to remember something 

 sssss  have they ever called me that   said kaa 

 something of that kind it was that they shouted to us last moon  but we
never noticed them  they will say anything  even that thou hast lost all
thy teeth  and wilt not face anything bigger than a kid  because  they
are indeed shameless  these bandar log   because thou art afraid of the
he goat s horns   bagheera went on sweetly 

now a snake  especially a wary old python like kaa  very seldom shows
that he is angry  but baloo and bagheera could see the big swallowing
muscles on either side of kaa s throat ripple and bulge 

 the bandar log have shifted their grounds   he said quietly   when i
came up into the sun today i heard them whooping among the tree tops  

 it  it is the bandar log that we follow now   said baloo  but the words
stuck in his throat  for that was the first time in his memory that one
of the jungle people had owned to being interested in the doings of the
monkeys 

 beyond doubt then it is no small thing that takes two such
hunters  leaders in their own jungle i am certain  on the trail of the
bandar log   kaa replied courteously  as he swelled with curiosity 

 indeed   baloo began   i am no more than the old and sometimes very
foolish teacher of the law to the seeonee wolf cubs  and bagheera
here   

 is bagheera   said the black panther  and his jaws shut with a snap 
for he did not believe in being humble   the trouble is this  kaa  those
nut stealers and pickers of palm leaves have stolen away our man cub of
whom thou hast perhaps heard  

 i heard some news from ikki  his quills make him presumptuous  of a
man thing that was entered into a wolf pack  but i did not believe  ikki
is full of stories half heard and very badly told  

 but it is true  he is such a man cub as never was   said baloo   the
best and wisest and boldest of man cubs  my own pupil  who shall
make the name of baloo famous through all the jungles  and besides 
i  we  love him  kaa  

 ts  ts   said kaa  weaving his head to and fro   i also have known what
love is  there are tales i could tell that   

 that need a clear night when we are all well fed to praise properly  
said bagheera quickly   our man cub is in the hands of the bandar log
now  and we know that of all the jungle people they fear kaa alone  

 they fear me alone  they have good reason   said kaa   chattering 
foolish  vain  vain  foolish  and chattering  are the monkeys  but a
man thing in their hands is in no good luck  they grow tired of the nuts
they pick  and throw them down  they carry a branch half a day  meaning
to do great things with it  and then they snap it in two  that man thing
is not to be envied  they called me also  `yellow fish  was it not  

 worm  worm  earth worm   said bagheera   as well as other things which
i cannot now say for shame  

 we must remind them to speak well of their master  aaa ssp  we must
help their wandering memories  now  whither went they with the cub  

 the jungle alone knows  toward the sunset  i believe   said baloo   we
had thought that thou wouldst know  kaa  

 i  how  i take them when they come in my way  but i do not hunt the
bandar log  or frogs  or green scum on a water hole  for that matter  

 up  up  up  up  hillo  illo  illo  look up  baloo of the seeonee wolf
pack  

baloo looked up to see where the voice came from  and there was rann the
kite  sweeping down with the sun shining on the upturned flanges of his
wings  it was near rann s bedtime  but he had ranged all over the jungle
looking for the bear and had missed him in the thick foliage 

 what is it   said baloo 

 i have seen mowgli among the bandar log  he bade me tell you  i
watched  the bandar log have taken him beyond the river to the monkey
city  to the cold lairs  they may stay there for a night  or ten nights 
or an hour  i have told the bats to watch through the dark time  that is
my message  good hunting  all you below  

 full gorge and a deep sleep to you  rann   cried bagheera   i will
remember thee in my next kill  and put aside the head for thee alone  o
best of kites  

 it is nothing  it is nothing  the boy held the master word  i could
have done no less   and rann circled up again to his roost 

 he has not forgotten to use his tongue   said baloo with a chuckle of
pride   to think of one so young remembering the master word for the
birds too while he was being pulled across trees  

 it was most firmly driven into him   said bagheera   but i am proud of
him  and now we must go to the cold lairs  

they all knew where that place was  but few of the jungle people ever
went there  because what they called the cold lairs was an old deserted
city  lost and buried in the jungle  and beasts seldom use a place that
men have once used  the wild boar will  but the hunting tribes do not 
besides  the monkeys lived there as much as they could be said to live
anywhere  and no self respecting animal would come within eyeshot of it
except in times of drought  when the half ruined tanks and reservoirs
held a little water 

 it is half a night s journey  at full speed   said bagheera  and baloo
looked very serious   i will go as fast as i can   he said anxiously 

 we dare not wait for thee  follow  baloo  we must go on the
quick foot  kaa and i  

 feet or no feet  i can keep abreast of all thy four   said kaa shortly 
baloo made one effort to hurry  but had to sit down panting  and so they
left him to come on later  while bagheera hurried forward  at the quick
panther canter  kaa said nothing  but  strive as bagheera might  the
huge rock python held level with him  when they came to a hill stream 
bagheera gained  because he bounded across while kaa swam  his head and
two feet of his neck clearing the water  but on level ground kaa made up
the distance 

 by the broken lock that freed me   said bagheera  when twilight had
fallen   thou art no slow goer  

 i am hungry   said kaa   besides  they called me speckled frog  

 worm  earth worm  and yellow to boot  

 all one  let us go on   and kaa seemed to pour himself along the
ground  finding the shortest road with his steady eyes  and keeping to
it 

in the cold lairs the monkey people were not thinking of mowgli s
friends at all  they had brought the boy to the lost city  and were
very much pleased with themselves for the time  mowgli had never seen an
indian city before  and though this was almost a heap of ruins it seemed
very wonderful and splendid  some king had built it long ago on a little
hill  you could still trace the stone causeways that led up to the
ruined gates where the last splinters of wood hung to the worn  rusted
hinges  trees had grown into and out of the walls  the battlements were
tumbled down and decayed  and wild creepers hung out of the windows of
the towers on the walls in bushy hanging clumps 

a great roofless palace crowned the hill  and the marble of the
courtyards and the fountains was split  and stained with red and green 
and the very cobblestones in the courtyard where the king s elephants
used to live had been thrust up and apart by grasses and young trees 
from the palace you could see the rows and rows of roofless houses that
made up the city looking like empty honeycombs filled with blackness 
the shapeless block of stone that had been an idol in the square where
four roads met  the pits and dimples at street corners where the public
wells once stood  and the shattered domes of temples with wild figs
sprouting on their sides  the monkeys called the place their city  and
pretended to despise the jungle people because they lived in the forest 
and yet they never knew what the buildings were made for nor how to
use them  they would sit in circles on the hall of the king s council
chamber  and scratch for fleas and pretend to be men  or they would run
in and out of the roofless houses and collect pieces of plaster and old
bricks in a corner  and forget where they had hidden them  and fight
and cry in scuffling crowds  and then break off to play up and down the
terraces of the king s garden  where they would shake the rose trees and
the oranges in sport to see the fruit and flowers fall  they explored
all the passages and dark tunnels in the palace and the hundreds of
little dark rooms  but they never remembered what they had seen and what
they had not  and so drifted about in ones and twos or crowds telling
each other that they were doing as men did  they drank at the tanks and
made the water all muddy  and then they fought over it  and then they
would all rush together in mobs and shout   there is no one in the
jungle so wise and good and clever and strong and gentle as the
bandar log   then all would begin again till they grew tired of the city
and went back to the tree tops  hoping the jungle people would notice
them 

mowgli  who had been trained under the law of the jungle  did not like
or understand this kind of life  the monkeys dragged him into the cold
lairs late in the afternoon  and instead of going to sleep  as mowgli
would have done after a long journey  they joined hands and danced about
and sang their foolish songs  one of the monkeys made a speech and told
his companions that mowgli s capture marked a new thing in the history
of the bandar log  for mowgli was going to show them how to weave sticks
and canes together as a protection against rain and cold  mowgli picked
up some creepers and began to work them in and out  and the monkeys
tried to imitate  but in a very few minutes they lost interest and began
to pull their friends  tails or jump up and down on all fours  coughing 

 i wish to eat   said mowgli   i am a stranger in this part of the
jungle  bring me food  or give me leave to hunt here  

twenty or thirty monkeys bounded away to bring him nuts and wild
pawpaws  but they fell to fighting on the road  and it was too much
trouble to go back with what was left of the fruit  mowgli was sore and
angry as well as hungry  and he roamed through the empty city giving the
strangers  hunting call from time to time  but no one answered him  and
mowgli felt that he had reached a very bad place indeed   all that baloo
has said about the bandar log is true   he thought to himself   they
have no law  no hunting call  and no leaders  nothing but foolish words
and little picking thievish hands  so if i am starved or killed here 
it will be all my own fault  but i must try to return to my own jungle 
baloo will surely beat me  but that is better than chasing silly rose
leaves with the bandar log  

no sooner had he walked to the city wall than the monkeys pulled him
back  telling him that he did not know how happy he was  and pinching
him to make him grateful  he set his teeth and said nothing  but
went with the shouting monkeys to a terrace above the red sandstone
reservoirs that were half full of rain water  there was a ruined
summer house of white marble in the center of the terrace  built for
queens dead a hundred years ago  the domed roof had half fallen in and
blocked up the underground passage from the palace by which the
queens used to enter  but the walls were made of screens of marble
tracery  beautiful milk white fretwork  set with agates and cornelians
and jasper and lapis lazuli  and as the moon came up behind the hill it
shone through the open work  casting shadows on the ground like black
velvet embroidery  sore  sleepy  and hungry as he was  mowgli could not
help laughing when the bandar log began  twenty at a time  to tell him
how great and wise and strong and gentle they were  and how foolish he
was to wish to leave them   we are great  we are free  we are wonderful 
we are the most wonderful people in all the jungle  we all say so  and
so it must be true   they shouted   now as you are a new listener and
can carry our words back to the jungle people so that they may notice us
in future  we will tell you all about our most excellent selves   mowgli
made no objection  and the monkeys gathered by hundreds and hundreds on
the terrace to listen to their own speakers singing the praises of the
bandar log  and whenever a speaker stopped for want of breath they would
all shout together   this is true  we all say so   mowgli nodded and
blinked  and said  yes  when they asked him a question  and his head
spun with the noise   tabaqui the jackal must have bitten all these
people   he said to himself   and now they have madness  certainly this
is dewanee  the madness  do they never go to sleep  now there is a cloud
coming to cover that moon  if it were only a big enough cloud i might
try to run away in the darkness  but i am tired  

that same cloud was being watched by two good friends in the ruined
ditch below the city wall  for bagheera and kaa  knowing well how
dangerous the monkey people were in large numbers  did not wish to run
any risks  the monkeys never fight unless they are a hundred to one  and
few in the jungle care for those odds 

 i will go to the west wall   kaa whispered   and come down swiftly with
the slope of the ground in my favor  they will not throw themselves upon
my back in their hundreds  but   

 i know it   said bagheera   would that baloo were here  but we must do
what we can  when that cloud covers the moon i shall go to the terrace 
they hold some sort of council there over the boy  

 good hunting   said kaa grimly  and glided away to the west wall  that
happened to be the least ruined of any  and the big snake was delayed
awhile before he could find a way up the stones  the cloud hid the moon 
and as mowgli wondered what would come next he heard bagheera s light
feet on the terrace  the black panther had raced up the slope almost
without a sound and was striking  he knew better than to waste time in
biting  right and left among the monkeys  who were seated round mowgli
in circles fifty and sixty deep  there was a howl of fright and rage 
and then as bagheera tripped on the rolling kicking bodies beneath him 
a monkey shouted   there is only one here  kill him  kill   a scuffling
mass of monkeys  biting  scratching  tearing  and pulling  closed over
bagheera  while five or six laid hold of mowgli  dragged him up the wall
of the summerhouse and pushed him through the hole of the broken dome 
a man trained boy would have been badly bruised  for the fall was a
good fifteen feet  but mowgli fell as baloo had taught him to fall  and
landed on his feet 

 stay there   shouted the monkeys   till we have killed thy friends  and
later we will play with thee  if the poison people leave thee alive  

 we be of one blood  ye and i   said mowgli  quickly giving the snake s
call  he could hear rustling and hissing in the rubbish all round him
and gave the call a second time  to make sure 

 even ssso  down hoods all   said half a dozen low voices  every ruin
in india becomes sooner or later a dwelling place of snakes  and the old
summerhouse was alive with cobras    stand still  little brother  for
thy feet may do us harm  

mowgli stood as quietly as he could  peering through the open work and
listening to the furious din of the fight round the black panther  the
yells and chatterings and scufflings  and bagheera s deep  hoarse cough
as he backed and bucked and twisted and plunged under the heaps of his
enemies  for the first time since he was born  bagheera was fighting for
his life 

 baloo must be at hand  bagheera would not have come alone   mowgli
thought  and then he called aloud   to the tank  bagheera  roll to the
water tanks  roll and plunge  get to the water  

bagheera heard  and the cry that told him mowgli was safe gave him new
courage  he worked his way desperately  inch by inch  straight for the
reservoirs  halting in silence  then from the ruined wall nearest the
jungle rose up the rumbling war shout of baloo  the old bear had done
his best  but he could not come before   bagheera   he shouted   i am
here  i climb  i haste  ahuwora  the stones slip under my feet  wait my
coming  o most infamous bandar log   he panted up the terrace only
to disappear to the head in a wave of monkeys  but he threw himself
squarely on his haunches  and  spreading out his forepaws  hugged as
many as he could hold  and then began to hit with a regular bat bat bat 
like the flipping strokes of a paddle wheel  a crash and a splash told
mowgli that bagheera had fought his way to the tank where the monkeys
could not follow  the panther lay gasping for breath  his head just
out of the water  while the monkeys stood three deep on the red steps 
dancing up and down with rage  ready to spring upon him from all sides
if he came out to help baloo  it was then that bagheera lifted up his
dripping chin  and in despair gave the snake s call for protection   we
be of one blood  ye and i   for he believed that kaa had turned tail
at the last minute  even baloo  half smothered under the monkeys on
the edge of the terrace  could not help chuckling as he heard the black
panther asking for help 

kaa had only just worked his way over the west wall  landing with a
wrench that dislodged a coping stone into the ditch  he had no intention
of losing any advantage of the ground  and coiled and uncoiled himself
once or twice  to be sure that every foot of his long body was in
working order  all that while the fight with baloo went on  and the
monkeys yelled in the tank round bagheera  and mang the bat  flying to
and fro  carried the news of the great battle over the jungle  till even
hathi the wild elephant trumpeted  and  far away  scattered bands of
the monkey folk woke and came leaping along the tree roads to help their
comrades in the cold lairs  and the noise of the fight roused all the
day birds for miles round  then kaa came straight  quickly  and anxious
to kill  the fighting strength of a python is in the driving blow of
his head backed by all the strength and weight of his body  if you can
imagine a lance  or a battering ram  or a hammer weighing nearly half
a ton driven by a cool  quiet mind living in the handle of it  you can
roughly imagine what kaa was like when he fought  a python four or five
feet long can knock a man down if he hits him fairly in the chest  and
kaa was thirty feet long  as you know  his first stroke was delivered
into the heart of the crowd round baloo  it was sent home with shut
mouth in silence  and there was no need of a second  the monkeys
scattered with cries of   kaa  it is kaa  run  run  

generations of monkeys had been scared into good behavior by the stories
their elders told them of kaa  the night thief  who could slip along the
branches as quietly as moss grows  and steal away the strongest monkey
that ever lived  of old kaa  who could make himself look so like a dead
branch or a rotten stump that the wisest were deceived  till the branch
caught them  kaa was everything that the monkeys feared in the jungle 
for none of them knew the limits of his power  none of them could look
him in the face  and none had ever come alive out of his hug  and so
they ran  stammering with terror  to the walls and the roofs of the
houses  and baloo drew a deep breath of relief  his fur was much thicker
than bagheera s  but he had suffered sorely in the fight  then kaa
opened his mouth for the first time and spoke one long hissing word  and
the far away monkeys  hurrying to the defense of the cold lairs  stayed
where they were  cowering  till the loaded branches bent and crackled
under them  the monkeys on the walls and the empty houses stopped
their cries  and in the stillness that fell upon the city mowgli heard
bagheera shaking his wet sides as he came up from the tank  then the
clamor broke out again  the monkeys leaped higher up the walls  they
clung around the necks of the big stone idols and shrieked as they
skipped along the battlements  while mowgli  dancing in the summerhouse 
put his eye to the screenwork and hooted owl fashion between his front
teeth  to show his derision and contempt 

 get the man cub out of that trap  i can do no more   bagheera gasped 
 let us take the man cub and go  they may attack again  

 they will not move till i order them  stay you sssso   kaa hissed  and
the city was silent once more   i could not come before  brother  but i
think i heard thee call   this was to bagheera 

 i  i may have cried out in the battle   bagheera answered   baloo  art
thou hurt 

 i am not sure that they did not pull me into a hundred little
bearlings   said baloo  gravely shaking one leg after the other   wow  i
am sore  kaa  we owe thee  i think  our lives  bagheera and i  

 no matter  where is the manling  

 here  in a trap  i cannot climb out   cried mowgli  the curve of the
broken dome was above his head 

 take him away  he dances like mao the peacock  he will crush our
young   said the cobras inside 

 hah   said kaa with a chuckle   he has friends everywhere  this
manling  stand back  manling  and hide you  o poison people  i break
down the wall  

kaa looked carefully till he found a discolored crack in the marble
tracery showing a weak spot  made two or three light taps with his head
to get the distance  and then lifting up six feet of his body clear
of the ground  sent home half a dozen full power smashing blows 
nose first  the screen work broke and fell away in a cloud of dust and
rubbish  and mowgli leaped through the opening and flung himself between
baloo and bagheera  an arm around each big neck 

 art thou hurt   said baloo  hugging him softly 

 i am sore  hungry  and not a little bruised  but  oh  they have handled
ye grievously  my brothers  ye bleed  

 others also   said bagheera  licking his lips and looking at the
monkey dead on the terrace and round the tank 

 it is nothing  it is nothing  if thou art safe  oh  my pride of all
little frogs   whimpered baloo 

 of that we shall judge later   said bagheera  in a dry voice that
mowgli did not at all like   but here is kaa to whom we owe the battle
and thou owest thy life  thank him according to our customs  mowgli  

mowgli turned and saw the great python s head swaying a foot above his
own 

 so this is the manling   said kaa   very soft is his skin  and he is
not unlike the bandar log  have a care  manling  that i do not mistake
thee for a monkey some twilight when i have newly changed my coat  

 we be one blood  thou and i   mowgli answered   i take my life from
thee tonight  my kill shall be thy kill if ever thou art hungry  o kaa  

 all thanks  little brother   said kaa  though his eyes twinkled   and
what may so bold a hunter kill  i ask that i may follow when next he
goes abroad  

 i kill nothing   i am too little   but i drive goats toward such as can
use them  when thou art empty come to me and see if i speak the truth 
i have some skill in these  he held out his hands   and if ever thou art
in a trap  i may pay the debt which i owe to thee  to bagheera  and to
baloo  here  good hunting to ye all  my masters  

 well said   growled baloo  for mowgli had returned thanks very
prettily  the python dropped his head lightly for a minute on mowgli s
shoulder   a brave heart and a courteous tongue   said he   they shall
carry thee far through the jungle  manling  but now go hence quickly
with thy friends  go and sleep  for the moon sets  and what follows it
is not well that thou shouldst see  

the moon was sinking behind the hills and the lines of trembling monkeys
huddled together on the walls and battlements looked like ragged shaky
fringes of things  baloo went down to the tank for a drink and bagheera
began to put his fur in order  as kaa glided out into the center of the
terrace and brought his jaws together with a ringing snap that drew all
the monkeys  eyes upon him 

 the moon sets   he said   is there yet light enough to see  

from the walls came a moan like the wind in the tree tops   we see  o
kaa  

 good  begins now the dance  the dance of the hunger of kaa  sit still
and watch  

he turned twice or thrice in a big circle  weaving his head from right
to left  then he began making loops and figures of eight with his
body  and soft  oozy triangles that melted into squares and five sided
figures  and coiled mounds  never resting  never hurrying  and never
stopping his low humming song  it grew darker and darker  till at last
the dragging  shifting coils disappeared  but they could hear the rustle
of the scales 

baloo and bagheera stood still as stone  growling in their throats 
their neck hair bristling  and mowgli watched and wondered 

 bandar log   said the voice of kaa at last   can ye stir foot or hand
without my order  speak  

 without thy order we cannot stir foot or hand  o kaa  

 good  come all one pace nearer to me  

the lines of the monkeys swayed forward helplessly  and baloo and
bagheera took one stiff step forward with them 

 nearer   hissed kaa  and they all moved again 

mowgli laid his hands on baloo and bagheera to get them away  and the
two great beasts started as though they had been waked from a dream 

 keep thy hand on my shoulder   bagheera whispered   keep it there  or i
must go back  must go back to kaa  aah  

 it is only old kaa making circles on the dust   said mowgli   let us
go   and the three slipped off through a gap in the walls to the jungle 

 whoof   said baloo  when he stood under the still trees again   never
more will i make an ally of kaa   and he shook himself all over 

 he knows more than we   said bagheera  trembling   in a little time 
had i stayed  i should have walked down his throat  

 many will walk by that road before the moon rises again   said baloo 
 he will have good hunting  after his own fashion  

 but what was the meaning of it all   said mowgli  who did not know
anything of a python s powers of fascination   i saw no more than a big
snake making foolish circles till the dark came  and his nose was all
sore  ho  ho  

 mowgli   said bagheera angrily   his nose was sore on thy account  as
my ears and sides and paws  and baloo s neck and shoulders are bitten
on thy account  neither baloo nor bagheera will be able to hunt with
pleasure for many days  

 it is nothing   said baloo   we have the man cub again  

 true  but he has cost us heavily in time which might have been spent in
good hunting  in wounds  in hair  i am half plucked along my back  and
last of all  in honor  for  remember  mowgli  i  who am the black
panther  was forced to call upon kaa for protection  and baloo and i
were both made stupid as little birds by the hunger dance  all this 
man cub  came of thy playing with the bandar log  

 true  it is true   said mowgli sorrowfully   i am an evil man cub  and
my stomach is sad in me  

 mf  what says the law of the jungle  baloo  

baloo did not wish to bring mowgli into any more trouble  but he could
not tamper with the law  so he mumbled   sorrow never stays punishment 
but remember  bagheera  he is very little  

 i will remember  but he has done mischief  and blows must be dealt now 
mowgli  hast thou anything to say  

 nothing  i did wrong  baloo and thou are wounded  it is just  

bagheera gave him half a dozen love taps from a panther s point of
view  they would hardly have waked one of his own cubs   but for a
seven year old boy they amounted to as severe a beating as you could
wish to avoid  when it was all over mowgli sneezed  and picked himself
up without a word 

 now   said bagheera   jump on my back  little brother  and we will go
home  

one of the beauties of jungle law is that punishment settles all scores 
there is no nagging afterward 

mowgli laid his head down on bagheera s back and slept so deeply that he
never waked when he was put down in the home cave

     here we go in a flung festoon 
     half way up to the jealous moon 
     don t you envy our pranceful bands 
     don t you wish you had extra hands 
     wouldn t you like if your tails were  so  
     curved in the shape of a cupid s bow 
        now you re angry  but  never mind 
        brother  thy tail hangs down behind 

     here we sit in a branchy row 
     thinking of beautiful things we know 
     dreaming of deeds that we mean to do 
     all complete  in a minute or two  
     something noble and wise and good 
     done by merely wishing we could 
        we ve forgotten  but  never mind 
        brother  thy tail hangs down behind 

     all the talk we ever have heard
     uttered by bat or beast or bird  
     hide or fin or scale or feather  
     jabber it quickly and all together 
     excellent   wonderful   once again 

     now we are talking just like men 
        let s pretend we are     never mind 
        brother  thy tail hangs down behind 
        this is the way of the monkey kind 

     then join our leaping lines that scumfish through the pines 
     that rocket by where  light and high  the wild grape swings 
     by the rubbish in our wake  and the noble noise we make 
     be sure  be sure  we re going to do some splendid things 




 tiger  tiger  

     what of the hunting  hunter bold 
        brother  the watch was long and cold 
     what of the quarry ye went to kill 
        brother  he crops in the jungle still 
     where is the power that made your pride 
        brother  it ebbs from my flank and side 
     where is the haste that ye hurry by 
        brother  i go to my lair  to die 

now we must go back to the first tale  when mowgli left the wolf s cave
after the fight with the pack at the council rock  he went down to the
plowed lands where the villagers lived  but he would not stop there
because it was too near to the jungle  and he knew that he had made at
least one bad enemy at the council  so he hurried on  keeping to
the rough road that ran down the valley  and followed it at a steady
jog trot for nearly twenty miles  till he came to a country that he
did not know  the valley opened out into a great plain dotted over with
rocks and cut up by ravines  at one end stood a little village  and at
the other the thick jungle came down in a sweep to the grazing grounds 
and stopped there as though it had been cut off with a hoe  all over the
plain  cattle and buffaloes were grazing  and when the little boys in
charge of the herds saw mowgli they shouted and ran away  and the yellow
pariah dogs that hang about every indian village barked  mowgli walked
on  for he was feeling hungry  and when he came to the village gate he
saw the big thorn bush that was drawn up before the gate at twilight 
pushed to one side 

 umph   he said  for he had come across more than one such barricade in
his night rambles after things to eat   so men are afraid of the people
of the jungle here also   he sat down by the gate  and when a man came
out he stood up  opened his mouth  and pointed down it to show that
he wanted food  the man stared  and ran back up the one street of the
village shouting for the priest  who was a big  fat man dressed in
white  with a red and yellow mark on his forehead  the priest came to
the gate  and with him at least a hundred people  who stared and talked
and shouted and pointed at mowgli 

 they have no manners  these men folk   said mowgli to himself   only
the gray ape would behave as they do   so he threw back his long hair
and frowned at the crowd 

 what is there to be afraid of   said the priest   look at the marks on
his arms and legs  they are the bites of wolves  he is but a wolf child
run away from the jungle  

of course  in playing together  the cubs had often nipped mowgli harder
than they intended  and there were white scars all over his arms and
legs  but he would have been the last person in the world to call these
bites  for he knew what real biting meant 

 arre  arre   said two or three women together   to be bitten by wolves 
poor child  he is a handsome boy  he has eyes like red fire  by my
honor  messua  he is not unlike thy boy that was taken by the tiger  

 let me look   said a woman with heavy copper rings on her wrists and
ankles  and she peered at mowgli under the palm of her hand   indeed he
is not  he is thinner  but he has the very look of my boy  

the priest was a clever man  and he knew that messua was wife to the
richest villager in the place  so he looked up at the sky for a minute
and said solemnly   what the jungle has taken the jungle has restored 
take the boy into thy house  my sister  and forget not to honor the
priest who sees so far into the lives of men  

 by the bull that bought me   said mowgli to himself   but all this
talking is like another looking over by the pack  well  if i am a man  a
man i must become  

the crowd parted as the woman beckoned mowgli to her hut  where there
was a red lacquered bedstead  a great earthen grain chest with funny
raised patterns on it  half a dozen copper cooking pots  an image of a
hindu god in a little alcove  and on the wall a real looking glass  such
as they sell at the country fairs 

she gave him a long drink of milk and some bread  and then she laid her
hand on his head and looked into his eyes  for she thought perhaps that
he might be her real son come back from the jungle where the tiger had
taken him  so she said   nathoo  o nathoo   mowgli did not show that he
knew the name   dost thou not remember the day when i gave thee thy new
shoes   she touched his foot  and it was almost as hard as horn   no  
she said sorrowfully   those feet have never worn shoes  but thou art
very like my nathoo  and thou shalt be my son  

mowgli was uneasy  because he had never been under a roof before  but as
he looked at the thatch  he saw that he could tear it out any time if he
wanted to get away  and that the window had no fastenings   what is the
good of a man   he said to himself at last   if he does not understand
man s talk  now i am as silly and dumb as a man would be with us in the
jungle  i must speak their talk  

it was not for fun that he had learned while he was with the wolves to
imitate the challenge of bucks in the jungle and the grunt of the little
wild pig  so  as soon as messua pronounced a word mowgli would imitate
it almost perfectly  and before dark he had learned the names of many
things in the hut 

there was a difficulty at bedtime  because mowgli would not sleep under
anything that looked so like a panther trap as that hut  and when they
shut the door he went through the window   give him his will   said
messua s husband   remember he can never till now have slept on a bed 
if he is indeed sent in the place of our son he will not run away  

so mowgli stretched himself in some long  clean grass at the edge of
the field  but before he had closed his eyes a soft gray nose poked him
under the chin 

 phew   said gray brother  he was the eldest of mother wolf s cubs  
 this is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles  thou smellest
of wood smoke and cattle  altogether like a man already  wake  little
brother  i bring news  

 are all well in the jungle   said mowgli  hugging him 

 all except the wolves that were burned with the red flower  now 
listen  shere khan has gone away to hunt far off till his coat grows
again  for he is badly singed  when he returns he swears that he will
lay thy bones in the waingunga  

 there are two words to that  i also have made a little promise  but
news is always good  i am tired to night   very tired with new things 
gray brother   but bring me the news always  

 thou wilt not forget that thou art a wolf  men will not make thee
forget   said gray brother anxiously 

 never  i will always remember that i love thee and all in our cave  but
also i will always remember that i have been cast out of the pack  

 and that thou mayest be cast out of another pack  men are only men 
little brother  and their talk is like the talk of frogs in a pond  when
i come down here again  i will wait for thee in the bamboos at the edge
of the grazing ground  

for three months after that night mowgli hardly ever left the village
gate  he was so busy learning the ways and customs of men  first he had
to wear a cloth round him  which annoyed him horribly  and then he had
to learn about money  which he did not in the least understand  and
about plowing  of which he did not see the use  then the little children
in the village made him very angry  luckily  the law of the jungle had
taught him to keep his temper  for in the jungle life and food depend on
keeping your temper  but when they made fun of him because he would not
play games or fly kites  or because he mispronounced some word  only the
knowledge that it was unsportsmanlike to kill little naked cubs kept him
from picking them up and breaking them in two 

he did not know his own strength in the least  in the jungle he knew he
was weak compared with the beasts  but in the village people said that
he was as strong as a bull 

and mowgli had not the faintest idea of the difference that caste makes
between man and man  when the potter s donkey slipped in the clay pit 
mowgli hauled it out by the tail  and helped to stack the pots for their
journey to the market at khanhiwara  that was very shocking  too  for
the potter is a low caste man  and his donkey is worse  when the priest
scolded him  mowgli threatened to put him on the donkey too  and the
priest told messua s husband that mowgli had better be set to work as
soon as possible  and the village head man told mowgli that he would
have to go out with the buffaloes next day  and herd them while they
grazed  no one was more pleased than mowgli  and that night  because he
had been appointed a servant of the village  as it were  he went off
to a circle that met every evening on a masonry platform under a great
fig tree  it was the village club  and the head man and the watchman and
the barber  who knew all the gossip of the village  and old buldeo  the
village hunter  who had a tower musket  met and smoked  the monkeys
sat and talked in the upper branches  and there was a hole under the
platform where a cobra lived  and he had his little platter of milk
every night because he was sacred  and the old men sat around the tree
and talked  and pulled at the big huqas  the water pipes  till far into
the night  they told wonderful tales of gods and men and ghosts  and
buldeo told even more wonderful ones of the ways of beasts in the
jungle  till the eyes of the children sitting outside the circle bulged
out of their heads  most of the tales were about animals  for the jungle
was always at their door  the deer and the wild pig grubbed up their
crops  and now and again the tiger carried off a man at twilight  within
sight of the village gates 

mowgli  who naturally knew something about what they were talking of 
had to cover his face not to show that he was laughing  while buldeo 
the tower musket across his knees  climbed on from one wonderful story
to another  and mowgli s shoulders shook 

buldeo was explaining how the tiger that had carried away messua s son
was a ghost tiger  and his body was inhabited by the ghost of a wicked 
old money lender  who had died some years ago   and i know that this is
true   he said   because purun dass always limped from the blow that he
got in a riot when his account books were burned  and the tiger that i
speak of he limps  too  for the tracks of his pads are unequal  

 true  true  that must be the truth   said the gray beards  nodding
together 

 are all these tales such cobwebs and moon talk   said mowgli   that
tiger limps because he was born lame  as everyone knows  to talk of the
soul of a money lender in a beast that never had the courage of a jackal
is child s talk  

buldeo was speechless with surprise for a moment  and the head man
stared 

 oho  it is the jungle brat  is it   said buldeo   if thou art so
wise  better bring his hide to khanhiwara  for the government has set
a hundred rupees on his life  better still  talk not when thy elders
speak  

mowgli rose to go   all the evening i have lain here listening   he
called back over his shoulder   and  except once or twice  buldeo has
not said one word of truth concerning the jungle  which is at his very
doors  how  then  shall i believe the tales of ghosts and gods and
goblins which he says he has seen  

 it is full time that boy went to herding   said the head man  while
buldeo puffed and snorted at mowgli s impertinence 

the custom of most indian villages is for a few boys to take the cattle
and buffaloes out to graze in the early morning  and bring them back
at night  the very cattle that would trample a white man to death allow
themselves to be banged and bullied and shouted at by children that
hardly come up to their noses  so long as the boys keep with the herds
they are safe  for not even the tiger will charge a mob of cattle  but
if they straggle to pick flowers or hunt lizards  they are sometimes
carried off  mowgli went through the village street in the dawn  sitting
on the back of rama  the great herd bull  the slaty blue buffaloes 
with their long  backward sweeping horns and savage eyes  rose out their
byres  one by one  and followed him  and mowgli made it very clear to
the children with him that he was the master  he beat the buffaloes with
a long  polished bamboo  and told kamya  one of the boys  to graze the
cattle by themselves  while he went on with the buffaloes  and to be
very careful not to stray away from the herd 

an indian grazing ground is all rocks and scrub and tussocks and little
ravines  among which the herds scatter and disappear  the buffaloes
generally keep to the pools and muddy places  where they lie wallowing
or basking in the warm mud for hours  mowgli drove them on to the edge
of the plain where the waingunga came out of the jungle  then he dropped
from rama s neck  trotted off to a bamboo clump  and found gray brother 
 ah   said gray brother   i have waited here very many days  what is the
meaning of this cattle herding work  

 it is an order   said mowgli   i am a village herd for a while  what
news of shere khan  

 he has come back to this country  and has waited here a long time for
thee  now he has gone off again  for the game is scarce  but he means to
kill thee  

 very good   said mowgli   so long as he is away do thou or one of the
four brothers sit on that rock  so that i can see thee as i come out of
the village  when he comes back wait for me in the ravine by the dhak
tree in the center of the plain  we need not walk into shere khan s
mouth  

then mowgli picked out a shady place  and lay down and slept while
the buffaloes grazed round him  herding in india is one of the laziest
things in the world  the cattle move and crunch  and lie down  and move
on again  and they do not even low  they only grunt  and the buffaloes
very seldom say anything  but get down into the muddy pools one after
another  and work their way into the mud till only their noses and
staring china blue eyes show above the surface  and then they lie like
logs  the sun makes the rocks dance in the heat  and the herd children
hear one kite  never any more  whistling almost out of sight overhead 
and they know that if they died  or a cow died  that kite would sweep
down  and the next kite miles away would see him drop and follow  and
the next  and the next  and almost before they were dead there would be
a score of hungry kites come out of nowhere  then they sleep and
wake and sleep again  and weave little baskets of dried grass and put
grasshoppers in them  or catch two praying mantises and make them fight 
or string a necklace of red and black jungle nuts  or watch a lizard
basking on a rock  or a snake hunting a frog near the wallows  then they
sing long  long songs with odd native quavers at the end of them  and
the day seems longer than most people s whole lives  and perhaps they
make a mud castle with mud figures of men and horses and buffaloes  and
put reeds into the men s hands  and pretend that they are kings and the
figures are their armies  or that they are gods to be worshiped  then
evening comes and the children call  and the buffaloes lumber up out of
the sticky mud with noises like gunshots going off one after the other 
and they all string across the gray plain back to the twinkling village
lights 

day after day mowgli would lead the buffaloes out to their wallows  and
day after day he would see gray brother s back a mile and a half away
across the plain  so he knew that shere khan had not come back   and day
after day he would lie on the grass listening to the noises round him 
and dreaming of old days in the jungle  if shere khan had made a false
step with his lame paw up in the jungles by the waingunga  mowgli would
have heard him in those long  still mornings 

at last a day came when he did not see gray brother at the signal place 
and he laughed and headed the buffaloes for the ravine by the dhk tree 
which was all covered with golden red flowers  there sat gray brother 
every bristle on his back lifted 

 he has hidden for a month to throw thee off thy guard  he crossed the
ranges last night with tabaqui  hot foot on thy trail   said the wolf 
panting 

mowgli frowned   i am not afraid of shere khan  but tabaqui is very
cunning  

 have no fear   said gray brother  licking his lips a little   i met
tabaqui in the dawn  now he is telling all his wisdom to the kites  but
he told me everything before i broke his back  shere khan s plan is to
wait for thee at the village gate this evening  for thee and for no one
else  he is lying up now  in the big dry ravine of the waingunga  

 has he eaten today  or does he hunt empty   said mowgli  for the answer
meant life and death to him 

 he killed at dawn   a pig   and he has drunk too  remember  shere khan
could never fast  even for the sake of revenge  

 oh  fool  fool  what a cub s cub it is  eaten and drunk too  and he
thinks that i shall wait till he has slept  now  where does he lie up 
if there were but ten of us we might pull him down as he lies  these
buffaloes will not charge unless they wind him  and i cannot speak their
language  can we get behind his track so that they may smell it  

 he swam far down the waingunga to cut that off   said gray brother 

 tabaqui told him that  i know  he would never have thought of it
alone   mowgli stood with his finger in his mouth  thinking   the big
ravine of the waingunga  that opens out on the plain not half a mile
from here  i can take the herd round through the jungle to the head of
the ravine and then sweep down  but he would slink out at the foot  we
must block that end  gray brother  canst thou cut the herd in two for
me  

 not i  perhaps  but i have brought a wise helper   gray brother trotted
off and dropped into a hole  then there lifted up a huge gray head that
mowgli knew well  and the hot air was filled with the most desolate cry
of all the jungle  the hunting howl of a wolf at midday 

 akela  akela   said mowgli  clapping his hands   i might have known
that thou wouldst not forget me  we have a big work in hand  cut the
herd in two  akela  keep the cows and calves together  and the bulls and
the plow buffaloes by themselves  

the two wolves ran  ladies  chain fashion  in and out of the herd  which
snorted and threw up its head  and separated into two clumps  in one 
the cow buffaloes stood with their calves in the center  and glared
and pawed  ready  if a wolf would only stay still  to charge down and
trample the life out of him  in the other  the bulls and the young bulls
snorted and stamped  but though they looked more imposing they were much
less dangerous  for they had no calves to protect  no six men could have
divided the herd so neatly 

 what orders   panted akela   they are trying to join again  

mowgli slipped on to rama s back   drive the bulls away to the left 
akela  gray brother  when we are gone  hold the cows together  and drive
them into the foot of the ravine  

 how far   said gray brother  panting and snapping 

 till the sides are higher than shere khan can jump   shouted mowgli 
 keep them there till we come down   the bulls swept off as akela bayed 
and gray brother stopped in front of the cows  they charged down on him 
and he ran just before them to the foot of the ravine  as akela drove
the bulls far to the left 

 well done  another charge and they are fairly started  careful 
now  careful  akela  a snap too much and the bulls will charge  hujah 
this is wilder work than driving black buck  didst thou think these
creatures could move so swiftly   mowgli called 

 i have  have hunted these too in my time   gasped akela in the dust 
 shall i turn them into the jungle  

 ay  turn  swiftly turn them  rama is mad with rage  oh  if i could only
tell him what i need of him to day  

the bulls were turned  to the right this time  and crashed into the
standing thicket  the other herd children  watching with the cattle half
a mile away  hurried to the village as fast as their legs could carry
them  crying that the buffaloes had gone mad and run away 

but mowgli s plan was simple enough  all he wanted to do was to make a
big circle uphill and get at the head of the ravine  and then take the
bulls down it and catch shere khan between the bulls and the cows  for
he knew that after a meal and a full drink shere khan would not be in
any condition to fight or to clamber up the sides of the ravine  he was
soothing the buffaloes now by voice  and akela had dropped far to the
rear  only whimpering once or twice to hurry the rear guard  it was a
long  long circle  for they did not wish to get too near the ravine and
give shere khan warning  at last mowgli rounded up the bewildered herd
at the head of the ravine on a grassy patch that sloped steeply down to
the ravine itself  from that height you could see across the tops of the
trees down to the plain below  but what mowgli looked at was the sides
of the ravine  and he saw with a great deal of satisfaction that they
ran nearly straight up and down  while the vines and creepers that hung
over them would give no foothold to a tiger who wanted to get out 

 let them breathe  akela   he said  holding up his hand   they have not
winded him yet  let them breathe  i must tell shere khan who comes  we
have him in the trap  

he put his hands to his mouth and shouted down the ravine  it was almost
like shouting down a tunnel  and the echoes jumped from rock to rock 

after a long time there came back the drawling  sleepy snarl of a
full fed tiger just wakened 

 who calls   said shere khan  and a splendid peacock fluttered up out of
the ravine screeching 

 i  mowgli  cattle thief  it is time to come to the council rock 
down  hurry them down  akela  down  rama  down  

the herd paused for an instant at the edge of the slope  but akela gave
tongue in the full hunting yell  and they pitched over one after the
other  just as steamers shoot rapids  the sand and stones spurting up
round them  once started  there was no chance of stopping  and before
they were fairly in the bed of the ravine rama winded shere khan and
bellowed 

 ha  ha   said mowgli  on his back   now thou knowest   and the torrent
of black horns  foaming muzzles  and staring eyes whirled down the
ravine just as boulders go down in floodtime  the weaker buffaloes being
shouldered out to the sides of the ravine where they tore through the
creepers  they knew what the business was before them  the terrible
charge of the buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope to stand 
shere khan heard the thunder of their hoofs  picked himself up  and
lumbered down the ravine  looking from side to side for some way of
escape  but the walls of the ravine were straight and he had to hold on 
heavy with his dinner and his drink  willing to do anything rather than
fight  the herd splashed through the pool he had just left  bellowing
till the narrow cut rang  mowgli heard an answering bellow from the foot
of the ravine  saw shere khan turn  the tiger knew if the worst came
to the worst it was better to meet the bulls than the cows with their
calves   and then rama tripped  stumbled  and went on again over
something soft  and  with the bulls at his heels  crashed full into the
other herd  while the weaker buffaloes were lifted clean off their feet
by the shock of the meeting  that charge carried both herds out into the
plain  goring and stamping and snorting  mowgli watched his time  and
slipped off rama s neck  laying about him right and left with his stick 

 quick  akela  break them up  scatter them  or they will be fighting one
another  drive them away  akela  hai  rama  hai  hai  hai  my children 
softly now  softly  it is all over  

akela and gray brother ran to and fro nipping the buffaloes  legs 
and though the herd wheeled once to charge up the ravine again  mowgli
managed to turn rama  and the others followed him to the wallows 

shere khan needed no more trampling  he was dead  and the kites were
coming for him already 

 brothers  that was a dog s death   said mowgli  feeling for the knife
he always carried in a sheath round his neck now that he lived with men 
 but he would never have shown fight  his hide will look well on the
council rock  we must get to work swiftly  

a boy trained among men would never have dreamed of skinning a ten foot
tiger alone  but mowgli knew better than anyone else how an animal s
skin is fitted on  and how it can be taken off  but it was hard work 
and mowgli slashed and tore and grunted for an hour  while the wolves
lolled out their tongues  or came forward and tugged as he ordered them 
presently a hand fell on his shoulder  and looking up he saw buldeo with
the tower musket  the children had told the village about the buffalo
stampede  and buldeo went out angrily  only too anxious to correct
mowgli for not taking better care of the herd  the wolves dropped out of
sight as soon as they saw the man coming 

 what is this folly   said buldeo angrily   to think that thou canst
skin a tiger  where did the buffaloes kill him  it is the lame tiger
too  and there is a hundred rupees on his head  well  well  we will
overlook thy letting the herd run off  and perhaps i will give thee one
of the rupees of the reward when i have taken the skin to khanhiwara  
he fumbled in his waist cloth for flint and steel  and stooped down to
singe shere khan s whiskers  most native hunters always singe a tiger s
whiskers to prevent his ghost from haunting them 

 hum   said mowgli  half to himself as he ripped back the skin of a
forepaw   so thou wilt take the hide to khanhiwara for the reward  and
perhaps give me one rupee  now it is in my mind that i need the skin for
my own use  heh  old man  take away that fire  

 what talk is this to the chief hunter of the village  thy luck and the
stupidity of thy buffaloes have helped thee to this kill  the tiger has
just fed  or he would have gone twenty miles by this time  thou canst
not even skin him properly  little beggar brat  and forsooth i  buldeo 
must be told not to singe his whiskers  mowgli  i will not give thee one
anna of the reward  but only a very big beating  leave the carcass  

 by the bull that bought me   said mowgli  who was trying to get at the
shoulder   must i stay babbling to an old ape all noon  here  akela 
this man plagues me  

buldeo  who was still stooping over shere khan s head  found himself
sprawling on the grass  with a gray wolf standing over him  while mowgli
went on skinning as though he were alone in all india 

 ye es   he said  between his teeth   thou art altogether right  buldeo 
thou wilt never give me one anna of the reward  there is an old war
between this lame tiger and myself  a very old war  and  i have won  

to do buldeo justice  if he had been ten years younger he would have
taken his chance with akela had he met the wolf in the woods  but a wolf
who obeyed the orders of this boy who had private wars with man eating
tigers was not a common animal  it was sorcery  magic of the worst kind 
thought buldeo  and he wondered whether the amulet round his neck would
protect him  he lay as still as still  expecting every minute to see
mowgli turn into a tiger too 

 maharaj  great king   he said at last in a husky whisper 

 yes   said mowgli  without turning his head  chuckling a little 

 i am an old man  i did not know that thou wast anything more than a
herdsboy  may i rise up and go away  or will thy servant tear me to
pieces  

 go  and peace go with thee  only  another time do not meddle with my
game  let him go  akela  

buldeo hobbled away to the village as fast as he could  looking back
over his shoulder in case mowgli should change into something terrible 
when he got to the village he told a tale of magic and enchantment and
sorcery that made the priest look very grave 

mowgli went on with his work  but it was nearly twilight before he and
the wolves had drawn the great gay skin clear of the body 

 now we must hide this and take the buffaloes home  help me to herd
them  akela  

the herd rounded up in the misty twilight  and when they got near the
village mowgli saw lights  and heard the conches and bells in the temple
blowing and banging  half the village seemed to be waiting for him
by the gate   that is because i have killed shere khan   he said
to himself  but a shower of stones whistled about his ears  and the
villagers shouted   sorcerer  wolf s brat  jungle demon  go away  get
hence quickly or the priest will turn thee into a wolf again  shoot 
buldeo  shoot  

the old tower musket went off with a bang  and a young buffalo bellowed
in pain 

 more sorcery   shouted the villagers   he can turn bullets  buldeo 
that was thy buffalo  

 now what is this   said mowgli  bewildered  as the stones flew thicker 

 they are not unlike the pack  these brothers of thine   said akela 
sitting down composedly   it is in my head that  if bullets mean
anything  they would cast thee out  

 wolf  wolf s cub  go away   shouted the priest  waving a sprig of the
sacred tulsi plant 

 again  last time it was because i was a man  this time it is because i
am a wolf  let us go  akela  

a woman  it was messua  ran across to the herd  and cried   oh  my son 
my son  they say thou art a sorcerer who can turn himself into a beast
at will  i do not believe  but go away or they will kill thee  buldeo
says thou art a wizard  but i know thou hast avenged nathoo s death  

 come back  messua   shouted the crowd   come back  or we will stone
thee  

mowgli laughed a little short ugly laugh  for a stone had hit him in
the mouth   run back  messua  this is one of the foolish tales they tell
under the big tree at dusk  i have at least paid for thy son s life 
farewell  and run quickly  for i shall send the herd in more swiftly
than their brickbats  i am no wizard  messua  farewell  

 now  once more  akela   he cried   bring the herd in  

the buffaloes were anxious enough to get to the village  they hardly
needed akela s yell  but charged through the gate like a whirlwind 
scattering the crowd right and left 

 keep count   shouted mowgli scornfully   it may be that i have stolen
one of them  keep count  for i will do your herding no more  fare you
well  children of men  and thank messua that i do not come in with my
wolves and hunt you up and down your street  

he turned on his heel and walked away with the lone wolf  and as he
looked up at the stars he felt happy   no more sleeping in traps for me 
akela  let us get shere khan s skin and go away  no  we will not hurt
the village  for messua was kind to me  

when the moon rose over the plain  making it look all milky  the
horrified villagers saw mowgli  with two wolves at his heels and a
bundle on his head  trotting across at the steady wolf s trot that eats
up the long miles like fire  then they banged the temple bells and blew
the conches louder than ever  and messua cried  and buldeo embroidered
the story of his adventures in the jungle  till he ended by saying that
akela stood up on his hind legs and talked like a man 

the moon was just going down when mowgli and the two wolves came to the
hill of the council rock  and they stopped at mother wolf s cave 

 they have cast me out from the man pack  mother   shouted mowgli   but
i come with the hide of shere khan to keep my word  

mother wolf walked stiffly from the cave with the cubs behind her  and
her eyes glowed as she saw the skin 

 i told him on that day  when he crammed his head and shoulders into
this cave  hunting for thy life  little frog  i told him that the hunter
would be the hunted  it is well done  

 little brother  it is well done   said a deep voice in the thicket 
 we were lonely in the jungle without thee   and bagheera came running
to mowgli s bare feet  they clambered up the council rock together  and
mowgli spread the skin out on the flat stone where akela used to sit 
and pegged it down with four slivers of bamboo  and akela lay down upon
it  and called the old call to the council   look  look well  o wolves  
exactly as he had called when mowgli was first brought there 

ever since akela had been deposed  the pack had been without a leader 
hunting and fighting at their own pleasure  but they answered the call
from habit  and some of them were lame from the traps they had fallen
into  and some limped from shot wounds  and some were mangy from eating
bad food  and many were missing  but they came to the council rock  all
that were left of them  and saw shere khan s striped hide on the rock 
and the huge claws dangling at the end of the empty dangling feet  it
was then that mowgli made up a song that came up into his throat all
by itself  and he shouted it aloud  leaping up and down on the rattling
skin  and beating time with his heels till he had no more breath left 
while gray brother and akela howled between the verses 

 look well  o wolves  have i kept my word   said mowgli  and the wolves
bayed  yes   and one tattered wolf howled 

 lead us again  o akela  lead us again  o man cub  for we be sick of
this lawlessness  and we would be the free people once more  

 nay   purred bagheera   that may not be  when ye are full fed  the
madness may come upon you again  not for nothing are ye called the free
people  ye fought for freedom  and it is yours  eat it  o wolves  

 man pack and wolf pack have cast me out   said mowgli   now i will hunt
alone in the jungle  

 and we will hunt with thee   said the four cubs 

so mowgli went away and hunted with the four cubs in the jungle from
that day on  but he was not always alone  because  years afterward  he
became a man and married 

but that is a story for grown ups 




mowgli s song

     that he sang at the council rock when he
     danced on shere khan s hide

     the song of mowgli  i  mowgli  am singing   let the jungle
        listen to the things i have done 

     shere khan said he would kill  would kill   at the gates in the
        twilight he would kill mowgli  the frog 

     he ate and he drank   drink deep  shere khan  for when wilt thou
        drink again   sleep and dream of the kill 

     i am alone on the grazing grounds   gray brother  come to me 
        come to me  lone wolf  for there is big game afoot 

     bring up the great bull buffaloes  the blue skinned herd bulls
        with the angry eyes   drive them to and fro as i order 

     sleepest thou still  shere khan   wake  oh  wake   here come i 
        and the bulls are behind 

     rama  the king of the buffaloes  stamped with his foot   waters of
        the waingunga  whither went shere khan 

     he is not ikki to dig holes  nor mao  the peacock  that he should
        fly   he is not mang the bat  to hang in the branches   little
        bamboos that creak together  tell me where he ran 

     ow   he is there   ahoo   he is there   under the feet of rama
        lies the lame one   up  shere khan 

     up and kill   here is meat  break the necks of the bulls 

     hsh   he is asleep   we will not wake him  for his strength is
        very great   the kites have come down to see it   the black
        ants have come up to know it   there is a great assembly in his
        honor 

     alala   i have no cloth to wrap me   the kites will see that i am
        naked   i am ashamed to meet all these people 

     lend me thy coat  shere khan   lend me thy gay striped coat that i
        may go to the council rock 

     by the bull that bought me i made a promise  a little promise 
        only thy coat is lacking before i keep my word 

     with the knife  with the knife that men use  with the knife of the
        hunter  i will stoop down for my gift 

     waters of the waingunga  shere khan gives me his coat for the love
        that he bears me   pull  gray brother   pull  akela   heavy is
        the hide of shere khan 

     the man pack are angry   they throw stones and talk child s talk 
        my mouth is bleeding   let me run away 

     through the night  through the hot night  run swiftly with me  my
        brothers   we will leave the lights of the village and go to
        the low moon 

     waters of the waingunga  the man pack have cast me out   i did
        them no harm  but they were afraid of me   why 

     wolf pack  ye have cast me out too   the jungle is shut to me and
        the village gates are shut   why 

     as mang flies between the beasts and birds  so fly i between the
        village and the jungle   why 

     i dance on the hide of shere khan  but my heart is very heavy   my
        mouth is cut and wounded with the stones from the village  but
        my heart is very light  because i have come back to the jungle 
        why 

     these two things fight together in me as the snakes fight in the
        spring   the water comes out of my eyes  yet i laugh while it
        falls   why 

     i am two mowglis  but the hide of shere khan is under my feet 

     all the jungle knows that i have killed shere khan   look  look
        well  o wolves 

     ahae   my heart is heavy with the things that i do not understand 




the white seal

     oh  hush thee  my baby  the night is behind us 
        and black are the waters that sparkled so green 
     the moon  o er the combers  looks downward to find us
        at rest in the hollows that rustle between 
     where billow meets billow  then soft be thy pillow 
        ah  weary wee flipperling  curl at thy ease 
     the storm shall not wake thee  nor shark overtake thee 
        asleep in the arms of the slow swinging seas 

                                              seal lullaby


all these things happened several years ago at a place called
novastoshnah  or north east point  on the island of st  paul  away and
away in the bering sea  limmershin  the winter wren  told me the tale
when he was blown on to the rigging of a steamer going to japan  and i
took him down into my cabin and warmed and fed him for a couple of days
till he was fit to fly back to st  paul s again  limmershin is a very
quaint little bird  but he knows how to tell the truth 

nobody comes to novastoshnah except on business  and the only people
who have regular business there are the seals  they come in the summer
months by hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of the cold gray sea 
for novastoshnah beach has the finest accommodation for seals of any
place in all the world 

sea catch knew that  and every spring would swim from whatever place
he happened to be in  would swim like a torpedo boat straight for
novastoshnah and spend a month fighting with his companions for a good
place on the rocks  as close to the sea as possible  sea catch was
fifteen years old  a huge gray fur seal with almost a mane on his
shoulders  and long  wicked dog teeth  when he heaved himself up on his
front flippers he stood more than four feet clear of the ground  and his
weight  if anyone had been bold enough to weigh him  was nearly seven
hundred pounds  he was scarred all over with the marks of savage fights 
but he was always ready for just one fight more  he would put his head
on one side  as though he were afraid to look his enemy in the face 
then he would shoot it out like lightning  and when the big teeth were
firmly fixed on the other seal s neck  the other seal might get away if
he could  but sea catch would not help him 

yet sea catch never chased a beaten seal  for that was against the rules
of the beach  he only wanted room by the sea for his nursery  but as
there were forty or fifty thousand other seals hunting for the same
thing each spring  the whistling  bellowing  roaring  and blowing on the
beach was something frightful 

from a little hill called hutchinson s hill  you could look over three
and a half miles of ground covered with fighting seals  and the surf was
dotted all over with the heads of seals hurrying to land and begin their
share of the fighting  they fought in the breakers  they fought in the
sand  and they fought on the smooth worn basalt rocks of the nurseries 
for they were just as stupid and unaccommodating as men  their wives
never came to the island until late in may or early in june  for they
did not care to be torn to pieces  and the young two   three   and
four year old seals who had not begun housekeeping went inland about
half a mile through the ranks of the fighters and played about on the
sand dunes in droves and legions  and rubbed off every single green
thing that grew  they were called the holluschickie  the bachelors  and
there were perhaps two or three hundred thousand of them at novastoshnah
alone 

sea catch had just finished his forty fifth fight one spring when
matkah  his soft  sleek  gentle eyed wife  came up out of the sea 
and he caught her by the scruff of the neck and dumped her down on his
reservation  saying gruffly   late as usual  where have you been  

it was not the fashion for sea catch to eat anything during the four
months he stayed on the beaches  and so his temper was generally bad 
matkah knew better than to answer back  she looked round and cooed   how
thoughtful of you  you ve taken the old place again  

 i should think i had   said sea catch   look at me  

he was scratched and bleeding in twenty places  one eye was almost out 
and his sides were torn to ribbons 

 oh  you men  you men   matkah said  fanning herself with her hind
flipper   why can t you be sensible and settle your places quietly  you
look as though you had been fighting with the killer whale  

 i haven t been doing anything but fight since the middle of may  the
beach is disgracefully crowded this season  i ve met at least a hundred
seals from lukannon beach  house hunting  why can t people stay where
they belong  

 i ve often thought we should be much happier if we hauled out at otter
island instead of this crowded place   said matkah 

 bah  only the holluschickie go to otter island  if we went there they
would say we were afraid  we must preserve appearances  my dear  

sea catch sunk his head proudly between his fat shoulders and pretended
to go to sleep for a few minutes  but all the time he was keeping a
sharp lookout for a fight  now that all the seals and their wives were
on the land  you could hear their clamor miles out to sea above the
loudest gales  at the lowest counting there were over a million seals
on the beach  old seals  mother seals  tiny babies  and holluschickie 
fighting  scuffling  bleating  crawling  and playing together  going
down to the sea and coming up from it in gangs and regiments  lying
over every foot of ground as far as the eye could reach  and skirmishing
about in brigades through the fog  it is nearly always foggy at
novastoshnah  except when the sun comes out and makes everything look
all pearly and rainbow colored for a little while 

kotick  matkah s baby  was born in the middle of that confusion  and he
was all head and shoulders  with pale  watery blue eyes  as tiny seals
must be  but there was something about his coat that made his mother
look at him very closely 

 sea catch   she said  at last   our baby s going to be white  

 empty clam shells and dry seaweed   snorted sea catch   there never has
been such a thing in the world as a white seal  

 i can t help that   said matkah   there s going to be now   and she
sang the low  crooning seal song that all the mother seals sing to their
babies 

     you mustn t swim till you re six weeks old 
        or your head will be sunk by your heels 
     and summer gales and killer whales
        are bad for baby seals 

     are bad for baby seals  dear rat 
        as bad as bad can be 
     but splash and grow strong 
     and you can t be wrong 
        child of the open sea 

of course the little fellow did not understand the words at first  he
paddled and scrambled about by his mother s side  and learned to scuffle
out of the way when his father was fighting with another seal  and the
two rolled and roared up and down the slippery rocks  matkah used to go
to sea to get things to eat  and the baby was fed only once in two days 
but then he ate all he could and throve upon it 

the first thing he did was to crawl inland  and there he met tens
of thousands of babies of his own age  and they played together like
puppies  went to sleep on the clean sand  and played again  the old
people in the nurseries took no notice of them  and the holluschickie
kept to their own grounds  and the babies had a beautiful playtime 

when matkah came back from her deep sea fishing she would go straight
to their playground and call as a sheep calls for a lamb  and wait until
she heard kotick bleat  then she would take the straightest of straight
lines in his direction  striking out with her fore flippers and knocking
the youngsters head over heels right and left  there were always a few
hundred mothers hunting for their children through the playgrounds  and
the babies were kept lively  but  as matkah told kotick   so long as you
don t lie in muddy water and get mange  or rub the hard sand into a cut
or scratch  and so long as you never go swimming when there is a heavy
sea  nothing will hurt you here  

little seals can no more swim than little children  but they are unhappy
till they learn  the first time that kotick went down to the sea a wave
carried him out beyond his depth  and his big head sank and his little
hind flippers flew up exactly as his mother had told him in the song 
and if the next wave had not thrown him back again he would have
drowned 

after that  he learned to lie in a beach pool and let the wash of the
waves just cover him and lift him up while he paddled  but he always
kept his eye open for big waves that might hurt  he was two weeks
learning to use his flippers  and all that while he floundered in and
out of the water  and coughed and grunted and crawled up the beach and
took catnaps on the sand  and went back again  until at last he found
that he truly belonged to the water 

then you can imagine the times that he had with his companions  ducking
under the rollers  or coming in on top of a comber and landing with a
swash and a splutter as the big wave went whirling far up the beach  or
standing up on his tail and scratching his head as the old people did 
or playing  i m the king of the castle  on slippery  weedy rocks that
just stuck out of the wash  now and then he would see a thin fin  like
a big shark s fin  drifting along close to shore  and he knew that that
was the killer whale  the grampus  who eats young seals when he can get
them  and kotick would head for the beach like an arrow  and the fin
would jig off slowly  as if it were looking for nothing at all 

late in october the seals began to leave st  paul s for the deep sea  by
families and tribes  and there was no more fighting over the nurseries 
and the holluschickie played anywhere they liked   next year   said
matkah to kotick   you will be a holluschickie  but this year you must
learn how to catch fish  

they set out together across the pacific  and matkah showed kotick how
to sleep on his back with his flippers tucked down by his side and his
little nose just out of the water  no cradle is so comfortable as the
long  rocking swell of the pacific  when kotick felt his skin tingle all
over  matkah told him he was learning the  feel of the water   and that
tingly  prickly feelings meant bad weather coming  and he must swim hard
and get away 

 in a little time   she said   you ll know where to swim to  but just
now we ll follow sea pig  the porpoise  for he is very wise   a school
of porpoises were ducking and tearing through the water  and little
kotick followed them as fast as he could   how do you know where to go
to   he panted  the leader of the school rolled his white eye and ducked
under   my tail tingles  youngster   he said   that means there s a gale
behind me  come along  when you re south of the sticky water  he meant
the equator  and your tail tingles  that means there s a gale in front
of you and you must head north  come along  the water feels bad here  

this was one of very many things that kotick learned  and he was always
learning  matkah taught him to follow the cod and the halibut along the
under sea banks and wrench the rockling out of his hole among the weeds 
how to skirt the wrecks lying a hundred fathoms below water and dart
like a rifle bullet in at one porthole and out at another as the fishes
ran  how to dance on the top of the waves when the lightning was racing
all over the sky  and wave his flipper politely to the stumpy tailed
albatross and the man of war hawk as they went down the wind  how to
jump three or four feet clear of the water like a dolphin  flippers
close to the side and tail curved  to leave the flying fish alone
because they are all bony  to take the shoulder piece out of a cod at
full speed ten fathoms deep  and never to stop and look at a boat or a
ship  but particularly a row boat  at the end of six months what kotick
did not know about deep sea fishing was not worth the knowing  and all
that time he never set flipper on dry ground 

one day  however  as he was lying half asleep in the warm water
somewhere off the island of juan fernandez  he felt faint and lazy all
over  just as human people do when the spring is in their legs  and he
remembered the good firm beaches of novastoshnah seven thousand miles
away  the games his companions played  the smell of the seaweed  the
seal roar  and the fighting  that very minute he turned north  swimming
steadily  and as he went on he met scores of his mates  all bound for
the same place  and they said   greeting  kotick  this year we are
all holluschickie  and we can dance the fire dance in the breakers off
lukannon and play on the new grass  but where did you get that coat  

kotick s fur was almost pure white now  and though he felt very proud of
it  he only said   swim quickly  my bones are aching for the land   and
so they all came to the beaches where they had been born  and heard the
old seals  their fathers  fighting in the rolling mist 

that night kotick danced the fire dance with the yearling seals  the sea
is full of fire on summer nights all the way down from novastoshnah to
lukannon  and each seal leaves a wake like burning oil behind him and a
flaming flash when he jumps  and the waves break in great phosphorescent
streaks and swirls  then they went inland to the holluschickie grounds
and rolled up and down in the new wild wheat and told stories of what
they had done while they had been at sea  they talked about the pacific
as boys would talk about a wood that they had been nutting in  and if
anyone had understood them he could have gone away and made such a chart
of that ocean as never was  the three  and four year old holluschickie
romped down from hutchinson s hill crying   out of the way  youngsters 
the sea is deep and you don t know all that s in it yet  wait till
you ve rounded the horn  hi  you yearling  where did you get that white
coat  

 i didn t get it   said kotick   it grew   and just as he was going to
roll the speaker over  a couple of black haired men with flat red faces
came from behind a sand dune  and kotick  who had never seen a man
before  coughed and lowered his head  the holluschickie just bundled off
a few yards and sat staring stupidly  the men were no less than kerick
booterin  the chief of the seal hunters on the island  and patalamon 
his son  they came from the little village not half a mile from the sea
nurseries  and they were deciding what seals they would drive up to the
killing pens  for the seals were driven just like sheep  to be turned
into seal skin jackets later on 

 ho   said patalamon   look  there s a white seal  

kerick booterin turned nearly white under his oil and smoke  for he was
an aleut  and aleuts are not clean people  then he began to mutter a
prayer   don t touch him  patalamon  there has never been a white seal
since  since i was born  perhaps it is old zaharrof s ghost  he was lost
last year in the big gale  

 i m not going near him   said patalamon   he s unlucky  do you really
think he is old zaharrof come back  i owe him for some gulls  eggs  

 don t look at him   said kerick   head off that drove of
four year olds  the men ought to skin two hundred to day  but it s the
beginning of the season and they are new to the work  a hundred will do 
quick  

patalamon rattled a pair of seal s shoulder bones in front of a herd
of holluschickie and they stopped dead  puffing and blowing  then he
stepped near and the seals began to move  and kerick headed them inland 
and they never tried to get back to their companions  hundreds and
hundreds of thousands of seals watched them being driven  but they went
on playing just the same  kotick was the only one who asked questions 
and none of his companions could tell him anything  except that the
men always drove seals in that way for six weeks or two months of every
year 

 i am going to follow   he said  and his eyes nearly popped out of his
head as he shuffled along in the wake of the herd 

 the white seal is coming after us   cried patalamon   that s the first
time a seal has ever come to the killing grounds alone  

 hsh  don t look behind you   said kerick   it is zaharrof s ghost  i
must speak to the priest about this  

the distance to the killing grounds was only half a mile  but it took an
hour to cover  because if the seals went too fast kerick knew that they
would get heated and then their fur would come off in patches when they
were skinned  so they went on very slowly  past sea lion s neck  past
webster house  till they came to the salt house just beyond the sight
of the seals on the beach  kotick followed  panting and wondering 
he thought that he was at the world s end  but the roar of the seal
nurseries behind him sounded as loud as the roar of a train in a tunnel 
then kerick sat down on the moss and pulled out a heavy pewter watch
and let the drove cool off for thirty minutes  and kotick could hear the
fog dew dripping off the brim of his cap  then ten or twelve men  each
with an iron bound club three or four feet long  came up  and kerick
pointed out one or two of the drove that were bitten by their companions
or too hot  and the men kicked those aside with their heavy boots made
of the skin of a walrus s throat  and then kerick said   let go   and
then the men clubbed the seals on the head as fast as they could 

ten minutes later little kotick did not recognize his friends any more 
for their skins were ripped off from the nose to the hind flippers 
whipped off and thrown down on the ground in a pile  that was enough
for kotick  he turned and galloped  a seal can gallop very swiftly for
a short time  back to the sea  his little new mustache bristling with
horror  at sea lion s neck  where the great sea lions sit on the edge
of the surf  he flung himself flipper overhead into the cool water and
rocked there  gasping miserably   what s here   said a sea lion gruffly 
for as a rule the sea lions keep themselves to themselves 

 scoochnie  ochen scoochnie     i m lonesome  very lonesome    said
kotick   they re killing all the holluschickie on all the beaches  

the sea lion turned his head inshore   nonsense   he said   your
friends are making as much noise as ever  you must have seen old kerick
polishing off a drove  he s done that for thirty years  

 it s horrible   said kotick  backing water as a wave went over him  and
steadying himself with a screw stroke of his flippers that brought him
all standing within three inches of a jagged edge of rock 

 well done for a yearling   said the sea lion  who could appreciate good
swimming   i suppose it is rather awful from your way of looking at it 
but if you seals will come here year after year  of course the men get
to know of it  and unless you can find an island where no men ever come
you will always be driven  

 isn t there any such island   began kotick 

 i ve followed the poltoos  the halibut  for twenty years  and i can t
say i ve found it yet  but look here  you seem to have a fondness for
talking to your betters  suppose you go to walrus islet and talk to
sea vitch  he may know something  don t flounce off like that  it s a
six mile swim  and if i were you i should haul out and take a nap first 
little one  

kotick thought that that was good advice  so he swam round to his own
beach  hauled out  and slept for half an hour  twitching all over  as
seals will  then he headed straight for walrus islet  a little low sheet
of rocky island almost due northeast from novastoshnah  all ledges and
rock and gulls  nests  where the walrus herded by themselves 

he landed close to old sea vitch  the big  ugly  bloated  pimpled 
fat necked  long tusked walrus of the north pacific  who has no manners
except when he is asleep  as he was then  with his hind flippers half in
and half out of the surf 

 wake up   barked kotick  for the gulls were making a great noise 

 hah  ho  hmph  what s that   said sea vitch  and he struck the next
walrus a blow with his tusks and waked him up  and the next struck the
next  and so on till they were all awake and staring in every direction
but the right one 

 hi  it s me   said kotick  bobbing in the surf and looking like a
little white slug 

 well  may i be  skinned   said sea vitch  and they all looked at kotick
as you can fancy a club full of drowsy old gentlemen would look at a
little boy  kotick did not care to hear any more about skinning just
then  he had seen enough of it  so he called out   isn t there any place
for seals to go where men don t ever come  

 go and find out   said sea vitch  shutting his eyes   run away  we re
busy here  

kotick made his dolphin jump in the air and shouted as loud as he could 
 clam eater  clam eater   he knew that sea vitch never caught a fish in
his life but always rooted for clams and seaweed  though he pretended to
be a very terrible person  naturally the chickies and the gooverooskies
and the epatkas  the burgomaster gulls and the kittiwakes and the
puffins  who are always looking for a chance to be rude  took up the
cry  and  so limmershin told me  for nearly five minutes you could not
have heard a gun fired on walrus islet  all the population was yelling
and screaming  clam eater  stareek  old man    while sea vitch rolled
from side to side grunting and coughing 

 now will you tell   said kotick  all out of breath 

 go and ask sea cow   said sea vitch   if he is living still  he ll be
able to tell you  

 how shall i know sea cow when i meet him   said kotick  sheering off 

 he s the only thing in the sea uglier than sea vitch   screamed a
burgomaster gull  wheeling under sea vitch s nose   uglier  and with
worse manners  stareek  

kotick swam back to novastoshnah  leaving the gulls to scream  there he
found that no one sympathized with him in his little attempt to discover
a quiet place for the seals  they told him that men had always driven
the holluschickie  it was part of the day s work  and that if he did not
like to see ugly things he should not have gone to the killing grounds 
but none of the other seals had seen the killing  and that made the
difference between him and his friends  besides  kotick was a white
seal 

 what you must do   said old sea catch  after he had heard his son s
adventures   is to grow up and be a big seal like your father  and have
a nursery on the beach  and then they will leave you alone  in another
five years you ought to be able to fight for yourself   even gentle
matkah  his mother  said   you will never be able to stop the killing 
go and play in the sea  kotick   and kotick went off and danced the
fire dance with a very heavy little heart 

that autumn he left the beach as soon as he could  and set off alone
because of a notion in his bullet head  he was going to find sea cow 
if there was such a person in the sea  and he was going to find a quiet
island with good firm beaches for seals to live on  where men could not
get at them  so he explored and explored by himself from the north to
the south pacific  swimming as much as three hundred miles in a day
and a night  he met with more adventures than can be told  and narrowly
escaped being caught by the basking shark  and the spotted shark  and
the hammerhead  and he met all the untrustworthy ruffians that loaf up
and down the seas  and the heavy polite fish  and the scarlet spotted
scallops that are moored in one place for hundreds of years  and grow
very proud of it  but he never met sea cow  and he never found an island
that he could fancy 

if the beach was good and hard  with a slope behind it for seals to play
on  there was always the smoke of a whaler on the horizon  boiling down
blubber  and kotick knew what that meant  or else he could see that
seals had once visited the island and been killed off  and kotick knew
that where men had come once they would come again 

he picked up with an old stumpy tailed albatross  who told him that
kerguelen island was the very place for peace and quiet  and when kotick
went down there he was all but smashed to pieces against some wicked
black cliffs in a heavy sleet storm with lightning and thunder  yet as
he pulled out against the gale he could see that even there had once
been a seal nursery  and it was so in all the other islands that he
visited 

limmershin gave a long list of them  for he said that kotick spent five
seasons exploring  with a four months  rest each year at novastoshnah 
when the holluschickie used to make fun of him and his imaginary
islands  he went to the gallapagos  a horrid dry place on the equator 
where he was nearly baked to death  he went to the georgia islands 
the orkneys  emerald island  little nightingale island  gough s island 
bouvet s island  the crossets  and even to a little speck of an island
south of the cape of good hope  but everywhere the people of the sea
told him the same things  seals had come to those islands once upon a
time  but men had killed them all off  even when he swam thousands of
miles out of the pacific and got to a place called cape corrientes  that
was when he was coming back from gough s island   he found a few hundred
mangy seals on a rock and they told him that men came there too 

that nearly broke his heart  and he headed round the horn back to his
own beaches  and on his way north he hauled out on an island full of
green trees  where he found an old  old seal who was dying  and kotick
caught fish for him and told him all his sorrows   now   said kotick 
 i am going back to novastoshnah  and if i am driven to the killing pens
with the holluschickie i shall not care  

the old seal said   try once more  i am the last of the lost rookery of
masafuera  and in the days when men killed us by the hundred thousand
there was a story on the beaches that some day a white seal would come
out of the north and lead the seal people to a quiet place  i am old 
and i shall never live to see that day  but others will  try once more  

and kotick curled up his mustache  it was a beauty  and said   i am the
only white seal that has ever been born on the beaches  and i am the
only seal  black or white  who ever thought of looking for new islands  

this cheered him immensely  and when he came back to novastoshnah that
summer  matkah  his mother  begged him to marry and settle down  for
he was no longer a holluschick but a full grown sea catch  with a curly
white mane on his shoulders  as heavy  as big  and as fierce as his
father   give me another season   he said   remember  mother  it is
always the seventh wave that goes farthest up the beach  

curiously enough  there was another seal who thought that she would put
off marrying till the next year  and kotick danced the fire dance with
her all down lukannon beach the night before he set off on his last
exploration  this time he went westward  because he had fallen on the
trail of a great shoal of halibut  and he needed at least one hundred
pounds of fish a day to keep him in good condition  he chased them till
he was tired  and then he curled himself up and went to sleep on the
hollows of the ground swell that sets in to copper island  he knew the
coast perfectly well  so about midnight  when he felt himself gently
bumped on a weed bed  he said   hm  tide s running strong tonight   and
turning over under water opened his eyes slowly and stretched  then
he jumped like a cat  for he saw huge things nosing about in the shoal
water and browsing on the heavy fringes of the weeds 

 by the great combers of magellan   he said  beneath his mustache   who
in the deep sea are these people  

they were like no walrus  sea lion  seal  bear  whale  shark  fish 
squid  or scallop that kotick had ever seen before  they were between
twenty and thirty feet long  and they had no hind flippers  but a
shovel like tail that looked as if it had been whittled out of wet
leather  their heads were the most foolish looking things you ever saw 
and they balanced on the ends of their tails in deep water when they
weren t grazing  bowing solemnly to each other and waving their front
flippers as a fat man waves his arm 

 ahem   said kotick   good sport  gentlemen   the big things answered by
bowing and waving their flippers like the frog footman  when they began
feeding again kotick saw that their upper lip was split into two pieces
that they could twitch apart about a foot and bring together again with
a whole bushel of seaweed between the splits  they tucked the stuff into
their mouths and chumped solemnly 

 messy style of feeding  that   said kotick  they bowed again  and
kotick began to lose his temper   very good   he said   if you do happen
to have an extra joint in your front flipper you needn t show off so  i
see you bow gracefully  but i should like to know your names   the split
lips moved and twitched  and the glassy green eyes stared  but they did
not speak 

 well   said kotick   you re the only people i ve ever met uglier than
sea vitch  and with worse manners  

then he remembered in a flash what the burgomaster gull had screamed
to him when he was a little yearling at walrus islet  and he tumbled
backward in the water  for he knew that he had found sea cow at last 

the sea cows went on schlooping and grazing and chumping in the weed 
and kotick asked them questions in every language that he had picked
up in his travels  and the sea people talk nearly as many languages as
human beings  but the sea cows did not answer because sea cow cannot
talk  he has only six bones in his neck where he ought to have seven 
and they say under the sea that that prevents him from speaking even
to his companions  but  as you know  he has an extra joint in his
foreflipper  and by waving it up and down and about he makes what
answers to a sort of clumsy telegraphic code 

by daylight kotick s mane was standing on end and his temper was gone
where the dead crabs go  then the sea cow began to travel northward very
slowly  stopping to hold absurd bowing councils from time to time  and
kotick followed them  saying to himself   people who are such idiots as
these are would have been killed long ago if they hadn t found out some
safe island  and what is good enough for the sea cow is good enough for
the sea catch  all the same  i wish they d hurry  

it was weary work for kotick  the herd never went more than forty or
fifty miles a day  and stopped to feed at night  and kept close to the
shore all the time  while kotick swam round them  and over them  and
under them  but he could not hurry them up one half mile  as they went
farther north they held a bowing council every few hours  and kotick
nearly bit off his mustache with impatience till he saw that they were
following up a warm current of water  and then he respected them more 

one night they sank through the shiny water  sank like stones  and for
the first time since he had known them began to swim quickly  kotick
followed  and the pace astonished him  for he never dreamed that sea cow
was anything of a swimmer  they headed for a cliff by the shore  a cliff
that ran down into deep water  and plunged into a dark hole at the
foot of it  twenty fathoms under the sea  it was a long  long swim  and
kotick badly wanted fresh air before he was out of the dark tunnel they
led him through 

 my wig   he said  when he rose  gasping and puffing  into open water at
the farther end   it was a long dive  but it was worth it  

the sea cows had separated and were browsing lazily along the edges of
the finest beaches that kotick had ever seen  there were long
stretches of smooth worn rock running for miles  exactly fitted to make
seal nurseries  and there were play grounds of hard sand sloping inland
behind them  and there were rollers for seals to dance in  and long
grass to roll in  and sand dunes to climb up and down  and  best of all 
kotick knew by the feel of the water  which never deceives a true sea
catch  that no men had ever come there 

the first thing he did was to assure himself that the fishing was good 
and then he swam along the beaches and counted up the delightful low
sandy islands half hidden in the beautiful rolling fog  away to the
northward  out to sea  ran a line of bars and shoals and rocks that
would never let a ship come within six miles of the beach  and between
the islands and the mainland was a stretch of deep water that ran up to
the perpendicular cliffs  and somewhere below the cliffs was the mouth
of the tunnel 

 it s novastoshnah over again  but ten times better   said kotick   sea
cow must be wiser than i thought  men can t come down the cliffs  even
if there were any men  and the shoals to seaward would knock a ship to
splinters  if any place in the sea is safe  this is it  

he began to think of the seal he had left behind him  but though he was
in a hurry to go back to novastoshnah  he thoroughly explored the new
country  so that he would be able to answer all questions 

then he dived and made sure of the mouth of the tunnel  and raced
through to the southward  no one but a sea cow or a seal would have
dreamed of there being such a place  and when he looked back at the
cliffs even kotick could hardly believe that he had been under them 

he was six days going home  though he was not swimming slowly  and when
he hauled out just above sea lion s neck the first person he met was the
seal who had been waiting for him  and she saw by the look in his eyes
that he had found his island at last 

but the holluschickie and sea catch  his father  and all the other seals
laughed at him when he told them what he had discovered  and a young
seal about his own age said   this is all very well  kotick  but you
can t come from no one knows where and order us off like this  remember
we ve been fighting for our nurseries  and that s a thing you never did 
you preferred prowling about in the sea  

the other seals laughed at this  and the young seal began twisting his
head from side to side  he had just married that year  and was making a
great fuss about it 

 i ve no nursery to fight for   said kotick   i only want to show you
all a place where you will be safe  what s the use of fighting  

 oh  if you re trying to back out  of course i ve no more to say   said
the young seal with an ugly chuckle 

 will you come with me if i win   said kotick  and a green light came
into his eye  for he was very angry at having to fight at all 

 very good   said the young seal carelessly   if you win  i ll come  

he had no time to change his mind  for kotick s head was out and his
teeth sunk in the blubber of the young seal s neck  then he threw
himself back on his haunches and hauled his enemy down the beach  shook
him  and knocked him over  then kotick roared to the seals   i ve done
my best for you these five seasons past  i ve found you the island where
you ll be safe  but unless your heads are dragged off your silly necks
you won t believe  i m going to teach you now  look out for yourselves  

limmershin told me that never in his life  and limmershin sees ten
thousand big seals fighting every year  never in all his little life
did he see anything like kotick s charge into the nurseries  he flung
himself at the biggest sea catch he could find  caught him by the
throat  choked him and bumped him and banged him till he grunted for
mercy  and then threw him aside and attacked the next  you see  kotick
had never fasted for four months as the big seals did every year  and
his deep sea swimming trips kept him in perfect condition  and  best
of all  he had never fought before  his curly white mane stood up with
rage  and his eyes flamed  and his big dog teeth glistened  and he was
splendid to look at  old sea catch  his father  saw him tearing past 
hauling the grizzled old seals about as though they had been halibut 
and upsetting the young bachelors in all directions  and sea catch gave
a roar and shouted   he may be a fool  but he is the best fighter on the
beaches  don t tackle your father  my son  he s with you  

kotick roared in answer  and old sea catch waddled in with his mustache
on end  blowing like a locomotive  while matkah and the seal that was
going to marry kotick cowered down and admired their men folk  it was
a gorgeous fight  for the two fought as long as there was a seal that
dared lift up his head  and when there were none they paraded grandly up
and down the beach side by side  bellowing 

at night  just as the northern lights were winking and flashing through
the fog  kotick climbed a bare rock and looked down on the scattered
nurseries and the torn and bleeding seals   now   he said   i ve taught
you your lesson  

 my wig   said old sea catch  boosting himself up stiffly  for he was
fearfully mauled   the killer whale himself could not have cut them up
worse  son  i m proud of you  and what s more  i ll come with you to
your island  if there is such a place  

 hear you  fat pigs of the sea  who comes with me to the sea cow s
tunnel  answer  or i shall teach you again   roared kotick 

there was a murmur like the ripple of the tide all up and down the
beaches   we will come   said thousands of tired voices   we will follow
kotick  the white seal  

then kotick dropped his head between his shoulders and shut his eyes
proudly  he was not a white seal any more  but red from head to tail 
all the same he would have scorned to look at or touch one of his
wounds 

a week later he and his army  nearly ten thousand holluschickie and old
seals  went away north to the sea cow s tunnel  kotick leading them 
and the seals that stayed at novastoshnah called them idiots  but next
spring  when they all met off the fishing banks of the pacific  kotick s
seals told such tales of the new beaches beyond sea cow s tunnel that
more and more seals left novastoshnah  of course it was not all done at
once  for the seals are not very clever  and they need a long time to
turn things over in their minds  but year after year more seals went
away from novastoshnah  and lukannon  and the other nurseries  to the
quiet  sheltered beaches where kotick sits all the summer through 
getting bigger and fatter and stronger each year  while the
holluschickie play around him  in that sea where no man comes 




lukannon

this is the great deep sea song that all the st  paul seals sing when
they are heading back to their beaches in the summer  it is a sort of
very sad seal national anthem 

     i met my mates in the morning  and  oh  but i am old  
     where roaring on the ledges the summer ground swell rolled 
     i heard them lift the chorus that drowned the breakers  song  
     the beaches of lukannon  two million voices strong 

     the song of pleasant stations beside the salt lagoons 
     the song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down the dunes 
     the song of midnight dances that churned the sea to flame  
     the beaches of lukannon  before the sealers came 

     i met my mates in the morning  i ll never meet them more   
     they came and went in legions that darkened all the shore 
     and o er the foam flecked offing as far as voice could reach
     we hailed the landing parties and we sang them up the beach 

     the beaches of lukannon  the winter wheat so tall  
     the dripping  crinkled lichens  and the sea fog drenching all 
     the platforms of our playground  all shining smooth and worn 
     the beaches of lukannon  the home where we were born 

     i met my mates in the morning  a broken  scattered band 
     men shoot us in the water and club us on the land 
     men drive us to the salt house like silly sheep and tame 
     and still we sing lukannon  before the sealers came 

     wheel down  wheel down to southward  oh  gooverooska  go 
     and tell the deep sea viceroys the story of our woe 
     ere  empty as the shark s egg the tempest flings ashore 
     the beaches of lukannon shall know their sons no more 




 rikki tikki tavi 

     at the hole where he went in
     red eye called to wrinkle skin 
     hear what little red eye saith 
      nag  come up and dance with death  

     eye to eye and head to head 
         keep the measure  nag  
     this shall end when one is dead 
         at thy pleasure  nag  
     turn for turn and twist for twist  
         run and hide thee  nag  
     hah   the hooded death has missed 
         woe betide thee  nag  

this is the story of the great war that rikki tikki tavi fought
single handed  through the bath rooms of the big bungalow in segowlee
cantonment  darzee  the tailorbird  helped him  and chuchundra  the
musk rat  who never comes out into the middle of the floor  but always
creeps round by the wall  gave him advice  but rikki tikki did the real
fighting 

he was a mongoose  rather like a little cat in his fur and his tail  but
quite like a weasel in his head and his habits  his eyes and the end
of his restless nose were pink  he could scratch himself anywhere he
pleased with any leg  front or back  that he chose to use  he could
fluff up his tail till it looked like a bottle brush  and his war cry as
he scuttled through the long grass was   rikk tikk tikki tikki tchk  

one day  a high summer flood washed him out of the burrow where he lived
with his father and mother  and carried him  kicking and clucking  down
a roadside ditch  he found a little wisp of grass floating there  and
clung to it till he lost his senses  when he revived  he was lying in
the hot sun on the middle of a garden path  very draggled indeed  and a
small boy was saying   here s a dead mongoose  let s have a funeral  

 no   said his mother   let s take him in and dry him  perhaps he isn t
really dead  

they took him into the house  and a big man picked him up between his
finger and thumb and said he was not dead but half choked  so they
wrapped him in cotton wool  and warmed him over a little fire  and he
opened his eyes and sneezed 

 now   said the big man  he was an englishman who had just moved into
the bungalow    don t frighten him  and we ll see what he ll do  

it is the hardest thing in the world to frighten a mongoose  because
he is eaten up from nose to tail with curiosity  the motto of all
the mongoose family is  run and find out   and rikki tikki was a true
mongoose  he looked at the cotton wool  decided that it was not good to
eat  ran all round the table  sat up and put his fur in order  scratched
himself  and jumped on the small boy s shoulder 

 don t be frightened  teddy   said his father   that s his way of making
friends  

 ouch  he s tickling under my chin   said teddy 

rikki tikki looked down between the boy s collar and neck  snuffed at
his ear  and climbed down to the floor  where he sat rubbing his nose 

 good gracious   said teddy s mother   and that s a wild creature  i
suppose he s so tame because we ve been kind to him  

 all mongooses are like that   said her husband   if teddy doesn t pick
him up by the tail  or try to put him in a cage  he ll run in and out of
the house all day long  let s give him something to eat  

they gave him a little piece of raw meat  rikki tikki liked it
immensely  and when it was finished he went out into the veranda and sat
in the sunshine and fluffed up his fur to make it dry to the roots  then
he felt better 

 there are more things to find out about in this house   he said to
himself   than all my family could find out in all their lives  i shall
certainly stay and find out  

he spent all that day roaming over the house  he nearly drowned himself
in the bath tubs  put his nose into the ink on a writing table  and
burned it on the end of the big man s cigar  for he climbed up in the
big man s lap to see how writing was done  at nightfall he ran into
teddy s nursery to watch how kerosene lamps were lighted  and when teddy
went to bed rikki tikki climbed up too  but he was a restless companion 
because he had to get up and attend to every noise all through the
night  and find out what made it  teddy s mother and father came in 
the last thing  to look at their boy  and rikki tikki was awake on
the pillow   i don t like that   said teddy s mother   he may bite the
child    he ll do no such thing   said the father   teddy s safer with
that little beast than if he had a bloodhound to watch him  if a snake
came into the nursery now   

but teddy s mother wouldn t think of anything so awful 

early in the morning rikki tikki came to early breakfast in the veranda
riding on teddy s shoulder  and they gave him banana and some boiled
egg  he sat on all their laps one after the other  because every
well brought up mongoose always hopes to be a house mongoose some day
and have rooms to run about in  and rikki tikki s mother  she used to
live in the general s house at segowlee  had carefully told rikki what
to do if ever he came across white men 

then rikki tikki went out into the garden to see what was to be seen 
it was a large garden  only half cultivated  with bushes  as big as
summer houses  of marshal niel roses  lime and orange trees  clumps of
bamboos  and thickets of high grass  rikki tikki licked his lips   this
is a splendid hunting ground   he said  and his tail grew bottle brushy
at the thought of it  and he scuttled up and down the garden  snuffing
here and there till he heard very sorrowful voices in a thorn bush 

it was darzee  the tailorbird  and his wife  they had made a beautiful
nest by pulling two big leaves together and stitching them up the edges
with fibers  and had filled the hollow with cotton and downy fluff  the
nest swayed to and fro  as they sat on the rim and cried 

 what is the matter   asked rikki tikki 

 we are very miserable   said darzee   one of our babies fell out of the
nest yesterday and nag ate him  

 h m   said rikki tikki   that is very sad  but i am a stranger here 
who is nag  

darzee and his wife only cowered down in the nest without answering  for
from the thick grass at the foot of the bush there came a low hiss  a
horrid cold sound that made rikki tikki jump back two clear feet  then
inch by inch out of the grass rose up the head and spread hood of nag 
the big black cobra  and he was five feet long from tongue to tail 
when he had lifted one third of himself clear of the ground  he stayed
balancing to and fro exactly as a dandelion tuft balances in the wind 
and he looked at rikki tikki with the wicked snake s eyes that never
change their expression  whatever the snake may be thinking of 

 who is nag   said he   i am nag  the great god brahm put his mark upon
all our people  when the first cobra spread his hood to keep the sun off
brahm as he slept  look  and be afraid  

he spread out his hood more than ever  and rikki tikki saw the
spectacle mark on the back of it that looks exactly like the eye part
of a hook and eye fastening  he was afraid for the minute  but it is
impossible for a mongoose to stay frightened for any length of time  and
though rikki tikki had never met a live cobra before  his mother had fed
him on dead ones  and he knew that all a grown mongoose s business in
life was to fight and eat snakes  nag knew that too and  at the bottom
of his cold heart  he was afraid 

 well   said rikki tikki  and his tail began to fluff up again   marks
or no marks  do you think it is right for you to eat fledglings out of a
nest  

nag was thinking to himself  and watching the least little movement in
the grass behind rikki tikki  he knew that mongooses in the garden
meant death sooner or later for him and his family  but he wanted to get
rikki tikki off his guard  so he dropped his head a little  and put it
on one side 

 let us talk   he said   you eat eggs  why should not i eat birds  

 behind you  look behind you   sang darzee 

rikki tikki knew better than to waste time in staring  he jumped up in
the air as high as he could go  and just under him whizzed by the head
of nagaina  nag s wicked wife  she had crept up behind him as he was
talking  to make an end of him  he heard her savage hiss as the stroke
missed  he came down almost across her back  and if he had been an old
mongoose he would have known that then was the time to break her back
with one bite  but he was afraid of the terrible lashing return stroke
of the cobra  he bit  indeed  but did not bite long enough  and he
jumped clear of the whisking tail  leaving nagaina torn and angry 

 wicked  wicked darzee   said nag  lashing up as high as he could reach
toward the nest in the thorn bush  but darzee had built it out of reach
of snakes  and it only swayed to and fro 

rikki tikki felt his eyes growing red and hot  when a mongoose s eyes
grow red  he is angry   and he sat back on his tail and hind legs like a
little kangaroo  and looked all round him  and chattered with rage  but
nag and nagaina had disappeared into the grass  when a snake misses its
stroke  it never says anything or gives any sign of what it means to do
next  rikki tikki did not care to follow them  for he did not feel sure
that he could manage two snakes at once  so he trotted off to the gravel
path near the house  and sat down to think  it was a serious matter for
him 

if you read the old books of natural history  you will find they say
that when the mongoose fights the snake and happens to get bitten 
he runs off and eats some herb that cures him  that is not true 
the victory is only a matter of quickness of eye and quickness of
foot  snake s blow against mongoose s jump  and as no eye can follow the
motion of a snake s head when it strikes  this makes things much more
wonderful than any magic herb  rikki tikki knew he was a young mongoose 
and it made him all the more pleased to think that he had managed to
escape a blow from behind  it gave him confidence in himself  and when
teddy came running down the path  rikki tikki was ready to be petted 

but just as teddy was stooping  something wriggled a little in the dust 
and a tiny voice said   be careful  i am death   it was karait  the
dusty brown snakeling that lies for choice on the dusty earth  and his
bite is as dangerous as the cobra s  but he is so small that nobody
thinks of him  and so he does the more harm to people 

rikki tikki s eyes grew red again  and he danced up to karait with the
peculiar rocking  swaying motion that he had inherited from his family 
it looks very funny  but it is so perfectly balanced a gait that you can
fly off from it at any angle you please  and in dealing with snakes this
is an advantage  if rikki tikki had only known  he was doing a much more
dangerous thing than fighting nag  for karait is so small  and can turn
so quickly  that unless rikki bit him close to the back of the head 
he would get the return stroke in his eye or his lip  but rikki did not
know  his eyes were all red  and he rocked back and forth  looking for
a good place to hold  karait struck out  rikki jumped sideways and
tried to run in  but the wicked little dusty gray head lashed within a
fraction of his shoulder  and he had to jump over the body  and the head
followed his heels close 

teddy shouted to the house   oh  look here  our mongoose is killing a
snake   and rikki tikki heard a scream from teddy s mother  his father
ran out with a stick  but by the time he came up  karait had lunged out
once too far  and rikki tikki had sprung  jumped on the snake s back 
dropped his head far between his forelegs  bitten as high up the back
as he could get hold  and rolled away  that bite paralyzed karait  and
rikki tikki was just going to eat him up from the tail  after the custom
of his family at dinner  when he remembered that a full meal makes a
slow mongoose  and if he wanted all his strength and quickness ready  he
must keep himself thin 

he went away for a dust bath under the castor oil bushes  while
teddy s father beat the dead karait   what is the use of that   thought
rikki tikki   i have settled it all   and then teddy s mother picked
him up from the dust and hugged him  crying that he had saved teddy
from death  and teddy s father said that he was a providence  and teddy
looked on with big scared eyes  rikki tikki was rather amused at all the
fuss  which  of course  he did not understand  teddy s mother might just
as well have petted teddy for playing in the dust  rikki was thoroughly
enjoying himself 

that night at dinner  walking to and fro among the wine glasses on the
table  he might have stuffed himself three times over with nice things 
but he remembered nag and nagaina  and though it was very pleasant to be
patted and petted by teddy s mother  and to sit on teddy s shoulder  his
eyes would get red from time to time  and he would go off into his long
war cry of  rikk tikk tikki tikki tchk  

teddy carried him off to bed  and insisted on rikki tikki sleeping under
his chin  rikki tikki was too well bred to bite or scratch  but as soon
as teddy was asleep he went off for his nightly walk round the house 
and in the dark he ran up against chuchundra  the musk rat  creeping
around by the wall  chuchundra is a broken hearted little beast  he
whimpers and cheeps all the night  trying to make up his mind to run
into the middle of the room  but he never gets there 

 don t kill me   said chuchundra  almost weeping   rikki tikki  don t
kill me  

 do you think a snake killer kills muskrats   said rikki tikki
scornfully 

 those who kill snakes get killed by snakes   said chuchundra  more
sorrowfully than ever   and how am i to be sure that nag won t mistake
me for you some dark night  

 there s not the least danger   said rikki tikki   but nag is in the
garden  and i know you don t go there  

 my cousin chua  the rat  told me    said chuchundra  and then he
stopped 

 told you what  

 h sh  nag is everywhere  rikki tikki  you should have talked to chua in
the garden  

 i didn t  so you must tell me  quick  chuchundra  or i ll bite you  

chuchundra sat down and cried till the tears rolled off his whiskers 
 i am a very poor man   he sobbed   i never had spirit enough to run out
into the middle of the room  h sh  i mustn t tell you anything  can t
you hear  rikki tikki  

rikki tikki listened  the house was as still as still  but he thought he
could just catch the faintest scratch scratch in the world  a noise as
faint as that of a wasp walking on a window pane  the dry scratch of a
snake s scales on brick work 

 that s nag or nagaina   he said to himself   and he is crawling into
the bath room sluice  you re right  chuchundra  i should have talked to
chua  

he stole off to teddy s bath room  but there was nothing there  and then
to teddy s mother s bathroom  at the bottom of the smooth plaster wall
there was a brick pulled out to make a sluice for the bath water  and as
rikki tikki stole in by the masonry curb where the bath is put  he heard
nag and nagaina whispering together outside in the moonlight 

 when the house is emptied of people   said nagaina to her husband   he
will have to go away  and then the garden will be our own again  go in
quietly  and remember that the big man who killed karait is the first
one to bite  then come out and tell me  and we will hunt for rikki tikki
together  

 but are you sure that there is anything to be gained by killing the
people   said nag 

 everything  when there were no people in the bungalow  did we have any
mongoose in the garden  so long as the bungalow is empty  we are king
and queen of the garden  and remember that as soon as our eggs in the
melon bed hatch  as they may tomorrow   our children will need room and
quiet  

 i had not thought of that   said nag   i will go  but there is no need
that we should hunt for rikki tikki afterward  i will kill the big man
and his wife  and the child if i can  and come away quietly  then the
bungalow will be empty  and rikki tikki will go  

rikki tikki tingled all over with rage and hatred at this  and then
nag s head came through the sluice  and his five feet of cold body
followed it  angry as he was  rikki tikki was very frightened as he saw
the size of the big cobra  nag coiled himself up  raised his head 
and looked into the bathroom in the dark  and rikki could see his eyes
glitter 

 now  if i kill him here  nagaina will know  and if i fight him on
the open floor  the odds are in his favor  what am i to do   said
rikki tikki tavi 

nag waved to and fro  and then rikki tikki heard him drinking from the
biggest water jar that was used to fill the bath   that is good   said
the snake   now  when karait was killed  the big man had a stick  he may
have that stick still  but when he comes in to bathe in the morning he
will not have a stick  i shall wait here till he comes  nagaina  do you
hear me   i shall wait here in the cool till daytime  

there was no answer from outside  so rikki tikki knew nagaina had gone
away  nag coiled himself down  coil by coil  round the bulge at the
bottom of the water jar  and rikki tikki stayed still as death  after an
hour he began to move  muscle by muscle  toward the jar  nag was asleep 
and rikki tikki looked at his big back  wondering which would be the
best place for a good hold   if i don t break his back at the first
jump   said rikki   he can still fight  and if he fights  o rikki   he
looked at the thickness of the neck below the hood  but that was too
much for him  and a bite near the tail would only make nag savage 

 it must be the head   he said at last   the head above the hood  and 
when i am once there  i must not let go  

then he jumped  the head was lying a little clear of the water jar 
under the curve of it  and  as his teeth met  rikki braced his back
against the bulge of the red earthenware to hold down the head  this
gave him just one second s purchase  and he made the most of it  then he
was battered to and fro as a rat is shaken by a dog  to and fro on the
floor  up and down  and around in great circles  but his eyes were red
and he held on as the body cart whipped over the floor  upsetting the
tin dipper and the soap dish and the flesh brush  and banged against the
tin side of the bath  as he held he closed his jaws tighter and tighter 
for he made sure he would be banged to death  and  for the honor of his
family  he preferred to be found with his teeth locked  he was dizzy 
aching  and felt shaken to pieces when something went off like a
thunderclap just behind him  a hot wind knocked him senseless and red
fire singed his fur  the big man had been wakened by the noise  and had
fired both barrels of a shotgun into nag just behind the hood 

rikki tikki held on with his eyes shut  for now he was quite sure he was
dead  but the head did not move  and the big man picked him up and said 
 it s the mongoose again  alice  the little chap has saved our lives
now  

then teddy s mother came in with a very white face  and saw what was
left of nag  and rikki tikki dragged himself to teddy s bedroom and
spent half the rest of the night shaking himself tenderly to find out
whether he really was broken into forty pieces  as he fancied 

when morning came he was very stiff  but well pleased with his doings 
 now i have nagaina to settle with  and she will be worse than five
nags  and there s no knowing when the eggs she spoke of will hatch 
goodness  i must go and see darzee   he said 

without waiting for breakfast  rikki tikki ran to the thornbush where
darzee was singing a song of triumph at the top of his voice  the news
of nag s death was all over the garden  for the sweeper had thrown the
body on the rubbish heap 

 oh  you stupid tuft of feathers   said rikki tikki angrily   is this
the time to sing  

 nag is dead  is dead  is dead   sang darzee   the valiant rikki tikki
caught him by the head and held fast  the big man brought the
bang stick  and nag fell in two pieces  he will never eat my babies
again  

 all that s true enough  but where s nagaina   said rikki tikki  looking
carefully round him 

 nagaina came to the bathroom sluice and called for nag   darzee went
on   and nag came out on the end of a stick  the sweeper picked him up
on the end of a stick and threw him upon the rubbish heap  let us sing
about the great  the red eyed rikki tikki   and darzee filled his throat
and sang 

 if i could get up to your nest  i d roll your babies out   said
rikki tikki   you don t know when to do the right thing at the right
time  you re safe enough in your nest there  but it s war for me down
here  stop singing a minute  darzee  

 for the great  the beautiful rikki tikki s sake i will stop   said
darzee   what is it  o killer of the terrible nag  

 where is nagaina  for the third time  

 on the rubbish heap by the stables  mourning for nag  great is
rikki tikki with the white teeth  

 bother my white teeth  have you ever heard where she keeps her eggs  

 in the melon bed  on the end nearest the wall  where the sun strikes
nearly all day  she hid them there weeks ago  

 and you never thought it worth while to tell me  the end nearest the
wall  you said  

 rikki tikki  you are not going to eat her eggs  

 not eat exactly  no  darzee  if you have a grain of sense you will fly
off to the stables and pretend that your wing is broken  and let nagaina
chase you away to this bush  i must get to the melon bed  and if i went
there now she d see me  

darzee was a feather brained little fellow who could never hold more
than one idea at a time in his head  and just because he knew that
nagaina s children were born in eggs like his own  he didn t think at
first that it was fair to kill them  but his wife was a sensible bird 
and she knew that cobra s eggs meant young cobras later on  so she flew
off from the nest  and left darzee to keep the babies warm  and continue
his song about the death of nag  darzee was very like a man in some
ways 

she fluttered in front of nagaina by the rubbish heap and cried out 
 oh  my wing is broken  the boy in the house threw a stone at me and
broke it   then she fluttered more desperately than ever 

nagaina lifted up her head and hissed   you warned rikki tikki when i
would have killed him  indeed and truly  you ve chosen a bad place to
be lame in   and she moved toward darzee s wife  slipping along over the
dust 

 the boy broke it with a stone   shrieked darzee s wife 

 well  it may be some consolation to you when you re dead to know that i
shall settle accounts with the boy  my husband lies on the rubbish heap
this morning  but before night the boy in the house will lie very still 
what is the use of running away  i am sure to catch you  little fool 
look at me  

darzee s wife knew better than to do that  for a bird who looks at a
snake s eyes gets so frightened that she cannot move  darzee s wife
fluttered on  piping sorrowfully  and never leaving the ground  and
nagaina quickened her pace 

rikki tikki heard them going up the path from the stables  and he raced
for the end of the melon patch near the wall  there  in the warm litter
above the melons  very cunningly hidden  he found twenty five eggs 
about the size of a bantam s eggs  but with whitish skin instead of
shell 

 i was not a day too soon   he said  for he could see the baby cobras
curled up inside the skin  and he knew that the minute they were hatched
they could each kill a man or a mongoose  he bit off the tops of the
eggs as fast as he could  taking care to crush the young cobras  and
turned over the litter from time to time to see whether he had missed
any  at last there were only three eggs left  and rikki tikki began to
chuckle to himself  when he heard darzee s wife screaming 

 rikki tikki  i led nagaina toward the house  and she has gone into the
veranda  and  oh  come quickly  she means killing  

rikki tikki smashed two eggs  and tumbled backward down the melon bed
with the third egg in his mouth  and scuttled to the veranda as hard as
he could put foot to the ground  teddy and his mother and father were
there at early breakfast  but rikki tikki saw that they were not eating
anything  they sat stone still  and their faces were white  nagaina was
coiled up on the matting by teddy s chair  within easy striking distance
of teddy s bare leg  and she was swaying to and fro  singing a song of
triumph 

 son of the big man that killed nag   she hissed   stay still  i am not
ready yet  wait a little  keep very still  all you three  if you move i
strike  and if you do not move i strike  oh  foolish people  who killed
my nag  

teddy s eyes were fixed on his father  and all his father could do was
to whisper   sit still  teddy  you mustn t move  teddy  keep still  

then rikki tikki came up and cried   turn round  nagaina  turn and
fight  

 all in good time   said she  without moving her eyes   i will settle my
account with you presently  look at your friends  rikki tikki  they are
still and white  they are afraid  they dare not move  and if you come a
step nearer i strike  

 look at your eggs   said rikki tikki   in the melon bed near the wall 
go and look  nagaina  

the big snake turned half around  and saw the egg on the veranda   ah h 
give it to me   she said 

rikki tikki put his paws one on each side of the egg  and his eyes were
blood red   what price for a snake s egg  for a young cobra  for a
young king cobra  for the last  the very last of the brood  the ants are
eating all the others down by the melon bed  

nagaina spun clear round  forgetting everything for the sake of the one
egg  rikki tikki saw teddy s father shoot out a big hand  catch teddy
by the shoulder  and drag him across the little table with the tea cups 
safe and out of reach of nagaina 

 tricked  tricked  tricked  rikk tck tck   chuckled rikki tikki   the
boy is safe  and it was i  i  i that caught nag by the hood last night
in the bathroom   then he began to jump up and down  all four feet
together  his head close to the floor   he threw me to and fro  but he
could not shake me off  he was dead before the big man blew him in two 
i did it  rikki tikki tck tck  come then  nagaina  come and fight with
me  you shall not be a widow long  

nagaina saw that she had lost her chance of killing teddy  and the egg
lay between rikki tikki s paws   give me the egg  rikki tikki  give me
the last of my eggs  and i will go away and never come back   she said 
lowering her hood 

 yes  you will go away  and you will never come back  for you will go
to the rubbish heap with nag  fight  widow  the big man has gone for his
gun  fight  

rikki tikki was bounding all round nagaina  keeping just out of reach
of her stroke  his little eyes like hot coals  nagaina gathered herself
together and flung out at him  rikki tikki jumped up and backward  again
and again and again she struck  and each time her head came with a whack
on the matting of the veranda and she gathered herself together like a
watch spring  then rikki tikki danced in a circle to get behind her  and
nagaina spun round to keep her head to his head  so that the rustle of
her tail on the matting sounded like dry leaves blown along by the wind 

he had forgotten the egg  it still lay on the veranda  and nagaina came
nearer and nearer to it  till at last  while rikki tikki was drawing
breath  she caught it in her mouth  turned to the veranda steps  and
flew like an arrow down the path  with rikki tikki behind her  when
the cobra runs for her life  she goes like a whip lash flicked across a
horse s neck 

rikki tikki knew that he must catch her  or all the trouble would begin
again  she headed straight for the long grass by the thorn bush  and as
he was running rikki tikki heard darzee still singing his foolish little
song of triumph  but darzee s wife was wiser  she flew off her nest
as nagaina came along  and flapped her wings about nagaina s head  if
darzee had helped they might have turned her  but nagaina only lowered
her hood and went on  still  the instant s delay brought rikki tikki up
to her  and as she plunged into the rat hole where she and nag used to
live  his little white teeth were clenched on her tail  and he went down
with her  and very few mongooses  however wise and old they may be 
care to follow a cobra into its hole  it was dark in the hole  and
rikki tikki never knew when it might open out and give nagaina room to
turn and strike at him  he held on savagely  and stuck out his feet to
act as brakes on the dark slope of the hot  moist earth 

then the grass by the mouth of the hole stopped waving  and darzee said 
 it is all over with rikki tikki  we must sing his death song  valiant
rikki tikki is dead  for nagaina will surely kill him underground  

so he sang a very mournful song that he made up on the spur of the
minute  and just as he got to the most touching part  the grass quivered
again  and rikki tikki  covered with dirt  dragged himself out of the
hole leg by leg  licking his whiskers  darzee stopped with a little
shout  rikki tikki shook some of the dust out of his fur and sneezed 
 it is all over   he said   the widow will never come out again   and
the red ants that live between the grass stems heard him  and began to
troop down one after another to see if he had spoken the truth 

rikki tikki curled himself up in the grass and slept where he was  slept
and slept till it was late in the afternoon  for he had done a hard
day s work 

 now   he said  when he awoke   i will go back to the house  tell the
coppersmith  darzee  and he will tell the garden that nagaina is dead  

the coppersmith is a bird who makes a noise exactly like the beating of
a little hammer on a copper pot  and the reason he is always making it
is because he is the town crier to every indian garden  and tells all
the news to everybody who cares to listen  as rikki tikki went up the
path  he heard his  attention  notes like a tiny dinner gong  and
then the steady  ding dong tock  nag is dead  dong  nagaina is dead 
ding dong tock   that set all the birds in the garden singing  and the
frogs croaking  for nag and nagaina used to eat frogs as well as little
birds 

when rikki got to the house  teddy and teddy s mother  she looked very
white still  for she had been fainting  and teddy s father came out and
almost cried over him  and that night he ate all that was given him till
he could eat no more  and went to bed on teddy s shoulder  where teddy s
mother saw him when she came to look late at night 

 he saved our lives and teddy s life   she said to her husband   just
think  he saved all our lives  

rikki tikki woke up with a jump  for the mongooses are light sleepers 

 oh  it s you   said he   what are you bothering for  all the cobras are
dead  and if they weren t  i m here  

rikki tikki had a right to be proud of himself  but he did not grow too
proud  and he kept that garden as a mongoose should keep it  with tooth
and jump and spring and bite  till never a cobra dared show its head
inside the walls 




darzee s chant

      sung in honor of rikki tikki tavi 

     singer and tailor am i  
        doubled the joys that i know  
     proud of my lilt to the sky 
        proud of the house that i sew  
     over and under  so weave i my music  so weave i the house that i
        sew 

     sing to your fledglings again 
        mother  oh lift up your head 
     evil that plagued us is slain 
        death in the garden lies dead 
     terror that hid in the roses is impotent  flung on the dung hill
     and dead 

     who has delivered us  who 
        tell me his nest and his name 
     rikki  the valiant  the true 
        tikki  with eyeballs of flame 
     rikk tikki tikki  the ivory fanged  the hunter with eyeballs of
     flame 

     give him the thanks of the birds 
        bowing with tail feathers spread 
     praise him with nightingale words  
        nay  i will praise him instead 
     hear   i will sing you the praise of the bottle tailed rikki  with
     eyeballs of red 

      here rikki tikki interrupted  and the rest of the song is
     lost  




toomai of the elephants

     i will remember what i was  i am sick of rope and chain  
        i will remember my old strength and all my forest affairs 
     i will not sell my back to man for a bundle of sugar cane 
        i will go out to my own kind  and the wood folk in their lairs 

     i will go out until the day  until the morning break  
        out to the wind s untainted kiss  the water s clean caress 
     i will forget my ankle ring and snap my picket stake 
        i will revisit my lost loves  and playmates masterless 

kala nag  which means black snake  had served the indian government in
every way that an elephant could serve it for forty seven years  and as
he was fully twenty years old when he was caught  that makes him nearly
seventy  a ripe age for an elephant  he remembered pushing  with a big
leather pad on his forehead  at a gun stuck in deep mud  and that was
before the afghan war of       and he had not then come to his full
strength 

his mother radha pyari   radha the darling   who had been caught in the
same drive with kala nag  told him  before his little milk tusks had
dropped out  that elephants who were afraid always got hurt  kala nag
knew that that advice was good  for the first time that he saw a shell
burst he backed  screaming  into a stand of piled rifles  and the
bayonets pricked him in all his softest places  so  before he was
twenty five  he gave up being afraid  and so he was the best loved
and the best looked after elephant in the service of the government of
india  he had carried tents  twelve hundred pounds  weight of tents  on
the march in upper india  he had been hoisted into a ship at the end of
a steam crane and taken for days across the water  and made to carry a
mortar on his back in a strange and rocky country very far from india 
and had seen the emperor theodore lying dead in magdala  and had
come back again in the steamer entitled  so the soldiers said  to the
abyssinian war medal  he had seen his fellow elephants die of cold and
epilepsy and starvation and sunstroke up at a place called ali musjid 
ten years later  and afterward he had been sent down thousands of miles
south to haul and pile big balks of teak in the timberyards at moulmein 
there he had half killed an insubordinate young elephant who was
shirking his fair share of work 

after that he was taken off timber hauling  and employed  with a few
score other elephants who were trained to the business  in helping to
catch wild elephants among the garo hills  elephants are very strictly
preserved by the indian government  there is one whole department which
does nothing else but hunt them  and catch them  and break them in  and
send them up and down the country as they are needed for work 

kala nag stood ten fair feet at the shoulders  and his tusks had been
cut off short at five feet  and bound round the ends  to prevent them
splitting  with bands of copper  but he could do more with those stumps
than any untrained elephant could do with the real sharpened ones  when 
after weeks and weeks of cautious driving of scattered elephants across
the hills  the forty or fifty wild monsters were driven into the last
stockade  and the big drop gate  made of tree trunks lashed together 
jarred down behind them  kala nag  at the word of command  would go
into that flaring  trumpeting pandemonium  generally at night  when
the flicker of the torches made it difficult to judge distances   and 
picking out the biggest and wildest tusker of the mob  would hammer
him and hustle him into quiet while the men on the backs of the other
elephants roped and tied the smaller ones 

there was nothing in the way of fighting that kala nag  the old wise
black snake  did not know  for he had stood up more than once in his
time to the charge of the wounded tiger  and  curling up his soft trunk
to be out of harm s way  had knocked the springing brute sideways in
mid air with a quick sickle cut of his head  that he had invented all by
himself  had knocked him over  and kneeled upon him with his huge knees
till the life went out with a gasp and a howl  and there was only a
fluffy striped thing on the ground for kala nag to pull by the tail 

 yes   said big toomai  his driver  the son of black toomai who had
taken him to abyssinia  and grandson of toomai of the elephants who had
seen him caught   there is nothing that the black snake fears except me 
he has seen three generations of us feed him and groom him  and he will
live to see four  

 he is afraid of me also   said little toomai  standing up to his full
height of four feet  with only one rag upon him  he was ten years old 
the eldest son of big toomai  and  according to custom  he would take
his father s place on kala nag s neck when he grew up  and would handle
the heavy iron ankus  the elephant goad  that had been worn smooth by
his father  and his grandfather  and his great grandfather 

he knew what he was talking of  for he had been born under kala nag s
shadow  had played with the end of his trunk before he could walk  had
taken him down to water as soon as he could walk  and kala nag would no
more have dreamed of disobeying his shrill little orders than he would
have dreamed of killing him on that day when big toomai carried the
little brown baby under kala nag s tusks  and told him to salute his
master that was to be 

 yes   said little toomai   he is afraid of me   and he took long
strides up to kala nag  called him a fat old pig  and made him lift up
his feet one after the other 

 wah   said little toomai   thou art a big elephant   and he wagged his
fluffy head  quoting his father   the government may pay for elephants 
but they belong to us mahouts  when thou art old  kala nag  there will
come some rich rajah  and he will buy thee from the government  on
account of thy size and thy manners  and then thou wilt have nothing
to do but to carry gold earrings in thy ears  and a gold howdah on thy
back  and a red cloth covered with gold on thy sides  and walk at the
head of the processions of the king  then i shall sit on thy neck  o
kala nag  with a silver ankus  and men will run before us with golden
sticks  crying  `room for the king s elephant   that will be good  kala
nag  but not so good as this hunting in the jungles  

 umph   said big toomai   thou art a boy  and as wild as a buffalo calf 
this running up and down among the hills is not the best government
service  i am getting old  and i do not love wild elephants  give me
brick elephant lines  one stall to each elephant  and big stumps to tie
them to safely  and flat  broad roads to exercise upon  instead of this
come and go camping  aha  the cawnpore barracks were good  there was a
bazaar close by  and only three hours  work a day  

little toomai remembered the cawnpore elephant lines and said nothing 
he very much preferred the camp life  and hated those broad  flat roads 
with the daily grubbing for grass in the forage reserve  and the long
hours when there was nothing to do except to watch kala nag fidgeting in
his pickets 

what little toomai liked was to scramble up bridle paths that only an
elephant could take  the dip into the valley below  the glimpses of the
wild elephants browsing miles away  the rush of the frightened pig and
peacock under kala nag s feet  the blinding warm rains  when all the
hills and valleys smoked  the beautiful misty mornings when nobody knew
where they would camp that night  the steady  cautious drive of the wild
elephants  and the mad rush and blaze and hullabaloo of the last night s
drive  when the elephants poured into the stockade like boulders in a
landslide  found that they could not get out  and flung themselves at
the heavy posts only to be driven back by yells and flaring torches and
volleys of blank cartridge 

even a little boy could be of use there  and toomai was as useful as
three boys  he would get his torch and wave it  and yell with the
best  but the really good time came when the driving out began  and the
keddah  that is  the stockade  looked like a picture of the end of the
world  and men had to make signs to one another  because they could not
hear themselves speak  then little toomai would climb up to the top of
one of the quivering stockade posts  his sun bleached brown hair flying
loose all over his shoulders  and he looking like a goblin in the
torch light  and as soon as there was a lull you could hear his
high pitched yells of encouragement to kala nag  above the trumpeting
and crashing  and snapping of ropes  and groans of the tethered
elephants   mael  mael  kala nag   go on  go on  black snake   dant do 
 give him the tusk   somalo  somalo   careful  careful   maro  mar   hit
him  hit him   mind the post  arre  arre  hai  yai  kya a ah   he would
shout  and the big fight between kala nag and the wild elephant would
sway to and fro across the keddah  and the old elephant catchers would
wipe the sweat out of their eyes  and find time to nod to little toomai
wriggling with joy on the top of the posts 

he did more than wriggle  one night he slid down from the post and
slipped in between the elephants and threw up the loose end of a rope 
which had dropped  to a driver who was trying to get a purchase on
the leg of a kicking young calf  calves always give more trouble than
full grown animals   kala nag saw him  caught him in his trunk  and
handed him up to big toomai  who slapped him then and there  and put him
back on the post 

next morning he gave him a scolding and said   are not good brick
elephant lines and a little tent carrying enough  that thou must needs
go elephant catching on thy own account  little worthless  now those
foolish hunters  whose pay is less than my pay  have spoken to petersen
sahib of the matter   little toomai was frightened  he did not know much
of white men  but petersen sahib was the greatest white man in the world
to him  he was the head of all the keddah operations  the man who caught
all the elephants for the government of india  and who knew more about
the ways of elephants than any living man 

 what  what will happen   said little toomai 

 happen  the worst that can happen  petersen sahib is a madman  else why
should he go hunting these wild devils  he may even require thee to be
an elephant catcher  to sleep anywhere in these fever filled jungles 
and at last to be trampled to death in the keddah  it is well that this
nonsense ends safely  next week the catching is over  and we of the
plains are sent back to our stations  then we will march on smooth
roads  and forget all this hunting  but  son  i am angry that thou
shouldst meddle in the business that belongs to these dirty assamese
jungle folk  kala nag will obey none but me  so i must go with him into
the keddah  but he is only a fighting elephant  and he does not help
to rope them  so i sit at my ease  as befits a mahout   not a mere
hunter   a mahout  i say  and a man who gets a pension at the end of
his service  is the family of toomai of the elephants to be trodden
underfoot in the dirt of a keddah  bad one  wicked one  worthless son 
go and wash kala nag and attend to his ears  and see that there are no
thorns in his feet  or else petersen sahib will surely catch thee and
make thee a wild hunter  a follower of elephant s foot tracks  a jungle
bear  bah  shame  go  

little toomai went off without saying a word  but he told kala nag all
his grievances while he was examining his feet   no matter   said little
toomai  turning up the fringe of kala nag s huge right ear   they
have said my name to petersen sahib  and perhaps  and perhaps  and
perhaps  who knows  hai  that is a big thorn that i have pulled out  

the next few days were spent in getting the elephants together  in
walking the newly caught wild elephants up and down between a couple of
tame ones to prevent them giving too much trouble on the downward march
to the plains  and in taking stock of the blankets and ropes and things
that had been worn out or lost in the forest 

petersen sahib came in on his clever she elephant pudmini  he had been
paying off other camps among the hills  for the season was coming to an
end  and there was a native clerk sitting at a table under a tree  to
pay the drivers their wages  as each man was paid he went back to his
elephant  and joined the line that stood ready to start  the catchers 
and hunters  and beaters  the men of the regular keddah  who stayed in
the jungle year in and year out  sat on the backs of the elephants that
belonged to petersen sahib s permanent force  or leaned against the
trees with their guns across their arms  and made fun of the drivers who
were going away  and laughed when the newly caught elephants broke the
line and ran about 

big toomai went up to the clerk with little toomai behind him  and
machua appa  the head tracker  said in an undertone to a friend of his 
 there goes one piece of good elephant stuff at least   tis a pity to
send that young jungle cock to molt in the plains  

now petersen sahib had ears all over him  as a man must have who listens
to the most silent of all living things  the wild elephant  he turned
where he was lying all along on pudmini s back and said   what is that 
i did not know of a man among the plains drivers who had wit enough to
rope even a dead elephant  

 this is not a man  but a boy  he went into the keddah at the last
drive  and threw barmao there the rope  when we were trying to get that
young calf with the blotch on his shoulder away from his mother  

machua appa pointed at little toomai  and petersen sahib looked  and
little toomai bowed to the earth 

 he throw a rope  he is smaller than a picket pin  little one  what is
thy name   said petersen sahib 

little toomai was too frightened to speak  but kala nag was behind him 
and toomai made a sign with his hand  and the elephant caught him up in
his trunk and held him level with pudmini s forehead  in front of the
great petersen sahib  then little toomai covered his face with his
hands  for he was only a child  and except where elephants were
concerned  he was just as bashful as a child could be 

 oho   said petersen sahib  smiling underneath his mustache   and why
didst thou teach thy elephant that trick  was it to help thee steal
green corn from the roofs of the houses when the ears are put out to
dry  

 not green corn  protector of the poor   melons   said little toomai 
and all the men sitting about broke into a roar of laughter  most of
them had taught their elephants that trick when they were boys  little
toomai was hanging eight feet up in the air  and he wished very much
that he were eight feet underground 

 he is toomai  my son  sahib   said big toomai  scowling   he is a very
bad boy  and he will end in a jail  sahib  

 of that i have my doubts   said petersen sahib   a boy who can face a
full keddah at his age does not end in jails  see  little one  here are
four annas to spend in sweetmeats because thou hast a little head under
that great thatch of hair  in time thou mayest become a hunter too   big
toomai scowled more than ever   remember  though  that keddahs are not
good for children to play in   petersen sahib went on 

 must i never go there  sahib   asked little toomai with a big gasp 

 yes   petersen sahib smiled again   when thou hast seen the elephants
dance  that is the proper time  come to me when thou hast seen the
elephants dance  and then i will let thee go into all the keddahs  

there was another roar of laughter  for that is an old joke among
elephant catchers  and it means just never  there are great cleared flat
places hidden away in the forests that are called elephants  ball rooms 
but even these are only found by accident  and no man has ever seen the
elephants dance  when a driver boasts of his skill and bravery the other
drivers say   and when didst thou see the elephants dance  

kala nag put little toomai down  and he bowed to the earth again and
went away with his father  and gave the silver four anna piece to his
mother  who was nursing his baby brother  and they all were put up on
kala nag s back  and the line of grunting  squealing elephants rolled
down the hill path to the plains  it was a very lively march on account
of the new elephants  who gave trouble at every ford  and needed coaxing
or beating every other minute 

big toomai prodded kala nag spitefully  for he was very angry  but
little toomai was too happy to speak  petersen sahib had noticed him 
and given him money  so he felt as a private soldier would feel if he
had been called out of the ranks and praised by his commander in chief 

 what did petersen sahib mean by the elephant dance   he said  at last 
softly to his mother 

big toomai heard him and grunted   that thou shouldst never be one of
these hill buffaloes of trackers  that was what he meant  oh  you in
front  what is blocking the way  

an assamese driver  two or three elephants ahead  turned round angrily 
crying   bring up kala nag  and knock this youngster of mine into good
behavior  why should petersen sahib have chosen me to go down with you
donkeys of the rice fields  lay your beast alongside  toomai  and
let him prod with his tusks  by all the gods of the hills  these new
elephants are possessed  or else they can smell their companions in the
jungle   kala nag hit the new elephant in the ribs and knocked the
wind out of him  as big toomai said   we have swept the hills of wild
elephants at the last catch  it is only your carelessness in driving 
must i keep order along the whole line  

 hear him   said the other driver   we have swept the hills  ho  ho  you
are very wise  you plains people  anyone but a mud head who never saw
the jungle would know that they know that the drives are ended for the
season  therefore all the wild elephants to night will  but why should i
waste wisdom on a river turtle  

 what will they do   little toomai called out 

 ohe  little one  art thou there  well  i will tell thee  for thou hast
a cool head  they will dance  and it behooves thy father  who has
swept all the hills of all the elephants  to double chain his pickets
to night  

 what talk is this   said big toomai   for forty years  father and son 
we have tended elephants  and we have never heard such moonshine about
dances  

 yes  but a plainsman who lives in a hut knows only the four walls
of his hut  well  leave thy elephants unshackled tonight and see what
comes  as for their dancing  i have seen the place where  bapree bap 
how many windings has the dihang river  here is another ford  and we
must swim the calves  stop still  you behind there  

and in this way  talking and wrangling and splashing through the rivers 
they made their first march to a sort of receiving camp for the new
elephants  but they lost their tempers long before they got there 

then the elephants were chained by their hind legs to their big stumps
of pickets  and extra ropes were fitted to the new elephants  and the
fodder was piled before them  and the hill drivers went back to petersen
sahib through the afternoon light  telling the plains drivers to be
extra careful that night  and laughing when the plains drivers asked the
reason 

little toomai attended to kala nag s supper  and as evening fell 
wandered through the camp  unspeakably happy  in search of a tom tom 
when an indian child s heart is full  he does not run about and make a
noise in an irregular fashion  he sits down to a sort of revel all by
himself  and little toomai had been spoken to by petersen sahib  if he
had not found what he wanted  i believe he would have been ill  but the
sweetmeat seller in the camp lent him a little tom tom  a drum beaten
with the flat of the hand  and he sat down  cross legged  before kala
nag as the stars began to come out  the tom tom in his lap  and he
thumped and he thumped and he thumped  and the more he thought of the
great honor that had been done to him  the more he thumped  all alone
among the elephant fodder  there was no tune and no words  but the
thumping made him happy 

the new elephants strained at their ropes  and squealed and trumpeted
from time to time  and he could hear his mother in the camp hut putting
his small brother to sleep with an old  old song about the great god
shiv  who once told all the animals what they should eat  it is a very
soothing lullaby  and the first verse says 

     shiv  who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow 
     sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago 
     gave to each his portion  food and toil and fate 
     from the king upon the guddee to the beggar at the gate 
        all things made he  shiva the preserver 
     mahadeo   mahadeo   he made all  
     thorn for the camel  fodder for the kine 
     and mother s heart for sleepy head  o little son of mine 

little toomai came in with a joyous tunk a tunk at the end of each
verse  till he felt sleepy and stretched himself on the fodder at kala
nag s side  at last the elephants began to lie down one after another
as is their custom  till only kala nag at the right of the line was
left standing up  and he rocked slowly from side to side  his ears put
forward to listen to the night wind as it blew very slowly across the
hills  the air was full of all the night noises that  taken together 
make one big silence  the click of one bamboo stem against the other 
the rustle of something alive in the undergrowth  the scratch and squawk
of a half waked bird  birds are awake in the night much more often than
we imagine   and the fall of water ever so far away  little toomai slept
for some time  and when he waked it was brilliant moonlight  and kala
nag was still standing up with his ears cocked  little toomai turned 
rustling in the fodder  and watched the curve of his big back against
half the stars in heaven  and while he watched he heard  so far away
that it sounded no more than a pinhole of noise pricked through the
stillness  the  hoot toot  of a wild elephant 

all the elephants in the lines jumped up as if they had been shot  and
their grunts at last waked the sleeping mahouts  and they came out and
drove in the picket pegs with big mallets  and tightened this rope and
knotted that till all was quiet  one new elephant had nearly grubbed up
his picket  and big toomai took off kala nag s leg chain and shackled
that elephant fore foot to hind foot  but slipped a loop of grass string
round kala nag s leg  and told him to remember that he was tied fast  he
knew that he and his father and his grandfather had done the very same
thing hundreds of times before  kala nag did not answer to the order
by gurgling  as he usually did  he stood still  looking out across the
moonlight  his head a little raised and his ears spread like fans  up to
the great folds of the garo hills 

 tend to him if he grows restless in the night   said big toomai to
little toomai  and he went into the hut and slept  little toomai was
just going to sleep  too  when he heard the coir string snap with a
little  tang   and kala nag rolled out of his pickets as slowly and as
silently as a cloud rolls out of the mouth of a valley  little toomai
pattered after him  barefooted  down the road in the moonlight  calling
under his breath   kala nag  kala nag  take me with you  o kala nag  
the elephant turned  without a sound  took three strides back to the
boy in the moonlight  put down his trunk  swung him up to his neck 
and almost before little toomai had settled his knees  slipped into the
forest 

there was one blast of furious trumpeting from the lines  and then the
silence shut down on everything  and kala nag began to move  sometimes
a tuft of high grass washed along his sides as a wave washes along the
sides of a ship  and sometimes a cluster of wild pepper vines would
scrape along his back  or a bamboo would creak where his shoulder
touched it  but between those times he moved absolutely without any
sound  drifting through the thick garo forest as though it had been
smoke  he was going uphill  but though little toomai watched the stars
in the rifts of the trees  he could not tell in what direction 

then kala nag reached the crest of the ascent and stopped for a minute 
and little toomai could see the tops of the trees lying all speckled and
furry under the moonlight for miles and miles  and the blue white mist
over the river in the hollow  toomai leaned forward and looked  and he
felt that the forest was awake below him  awake and alive and crowded 
a big brown fruit eating bat brushed past his ear  a porcupine s quills
rattled in the thicket  and in the darkness between the tree stems he
heard a hog bear digging hard in the moist warm earth  and snuffing as
it digged 

then the branches closed over his head again  and kala nag began to go
down into the valley  not quietly this time  but as a runaway gun goes
down a steep bank  in one rush  the huge limbs moved as steadily as
pistons  eight feet to each stride  and the wrinkled skin of the elbow
points rustled  the undergrowth on either side of him ripped with a
noise like torn canvas  and the saplings that he heaved away right and
left with his shoulders sprang back again and banged him on the flank 
and great trails of creepers  all matted together  hung from his tusks
as he threw his head from side to side and plowed out his pathway  then
little toomai laid himself down close to the great neck lest a swinging
bough should sweep him to the ground  and he wished that he were back in
the lines again 

the grass began to get squashy  and kala nag s feet sucked and squelched
as he put them down  and the night mist at the bottom of the valley
chilled little toomai  there was a splash and a trample  and the rush of
running water  and kala nag strode through the bed of a river  feeling
his way at each step  above the noise of the water  as it swirled round
the elephant s legs  little toomai could hear more splashing and some
trumpeting both upstream and down  great grunts and angry snortings  and
all the mist about him seemed to be full of rolling  wavy shadows 

 ai   he said  half aloud  his teeth chattering   the elephant folk are
out tonight  it is the dance  then  

kala nag swashed out of the water  blew his trunk clear  and began
another climb  but this time he was not alone  and he had not to make
his path  that was made already  six feet wide  in front of him  where
the bent jungle grass was trying to recover itself and stand up  many
elephants must have gone that way only a few minutes before  little
toomai looked back  and behind him a great wild tusker with his little
pig s eyes glowing like hot coals was just lifting himself out of the
misty river  then the trees closed up again  and they went on and up 
with trumpetings and crashings  and the sound of breaking branches on
every side of them 

at last kala nag stood still between two tree trunks at the very top
of the hill  they were part of a circle of trees that grew round an
irregular space of some three or four acres  and in all that space  as
little toomai could see  the ground had been trampled down as hard as
a brick floor  some trees grew in the center of the clearing  but their
bark was rubbed away  and the white wood beneath showed all shiny and
polished in the patches of moonlight  there were creepers hanging from
the upper branches  and the bells of the flowers of the creepers  great
waxy white things like convolvuluses  hung down fast asleep  but
within the limits of the clearing there was not a single blade of
green  nothing but the trampled earth 

the moonlight showed it all iron gray  except where some elephants
stood upon it  and their shadows were inky black  little toomai looked 
holding his breath  with his eyes starting out of his head  and as he
looked  more and more and more elephants swung out into the open from
between the tree trunks  little toomai could only count up to ten  and
he counted again and again on his fingers till he lost count of the
tens  and his head began to swim  outside the clearing he could hear
them crashing in the undergrowth as they worked their way up the
hillside  but as soon as they were within the circle of the tree trunks
they moved like ghosts 

there were white tusked wild males  with fallen leaves and nuts and
twigs lying in the wrinkles of their necks and the folds of their ears 
fat  slow footed she elephants  with restless  little pinky black
calves only three or four feet high running under their stomachs  young
elephants with their tusks just beginning to show  and very proud of
them  lanky  scraggy old maid elephants  with their hollow anxious
faces  and trunks like rough bark  savage old bull elephants  scarred
from shoulder to flank with great weals and cuts of bygone fights 
and the caked dirt of their solitary mud baths dropping from their
shoulders  and there was one with a broken tusk and the marks of the
full stroke  the terrible drawing scrape  of a tiger s claws on his
side 

they were standing head to head  or walking to and fro across the ground
in couples  or rocking and swaying all by themselves  scores and scores
of elephants 

toomai knew that so long as he lay still on kala nag s neck nothing
would happen to him  for even in the rush and scramble of a keddah drive
a wild elephant does not reach up with his trunk and drag a man off the
neck of a tame elephant  and these elephants were not thinking of men
that night  once they started and put their ears forward when they heard
the chinking of a leg iron in the forest  but it was pudmini  petersen
sahib s pet elephant  her chain snapped short off  grunting  snuffling
up the hillside  she must have broken her pickets and come straight from
petersen sahib s camp  and little toomai saw another elephant  one that
he did not know  with deep rope galls on his back and breast  he  too 
must have run away from some camp in the hills about 

at last there was no sound of any more elephants moving in the forest 
and kala nag rolled out from his station between the trees and went into
the middle of the crowd  clucking and gurgling  and all the elephants
began to talk in their own tongue  and to move about 

still lying down  little toomai looked down upon scores and scores of
broad backs  and wagging ears  and tossing trunks  and little rolling
eyes  he heard the click of tusks as they crossed other tusks by
accident  and the dry rustle of trunks twined together  and the chafing
of enormous sides and shoulders in the crowd  and the incessant flick
and hissh of the great tails  then a cloud came over the moon  and he
sat in black darkness  but the quiet  steady hustling and pushing and
gurgling went on just the same  he knew that there were elephants all
round kala nag  and that there was no chance of backing him out of the
assembly  so he set his teeth and shivered  in a keddah at least there
was torchlight and shouting  but here he was all alone in the dark  and
once a trunk came up and touched him on the knee 

then an elephant trumpeted  and they all took it up for five or ten
terrible seconds  the dew from the trees above spattered down like rain
on the unseen backs  and a dull booming noise began  not very loud at
first  and little toomai could not tell what it was  but it grew and
grew  and kala nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other  and
brought them down on the ground  one two  one two  as steadily as
trip hammers  the elephants were stamping all together now  and it
sounded like a war drum beaten at the mouth of a cave  the dew fell from
the trees till there was no more left to fall  and the booming went on 
and the ground rocked and shivered  and little toomai put his hands up
to his ears to shut out the sound  but it was all one gigantic jar that
ran through him  this stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth 
once or twice he could feel kala nag and all the others surge forward
a few strides  and the thumping would change to the crushing sound of
juicy green things being bruised  but in a minute or two the boom
of feet on hard earth began again  a tree was creaking and groaning
somewhere near him  he put out his arm and felt the bark  but kala nag
moved forward  still tramping  and he could not tell where he was in the
clearing  there was no sound from the elephants  except once  when two
or three little calves squeaked together  then he heard a thump and a
shuffle  and the booming went on  it must have lasted fully two hours 
and little toomai ached in every nerve  but he knew by the smell of the
night air that the dawn was coming 

the morning broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind the green hills 
and the booming stopped with the first ray  as though the light had
been an order  before little toomai had got the ringing out of his head 
before even he had shifted his position  there was not an elephant in
sight except kala nag  pudmini  and the elephant with the rope galls 
and there was neither sign nor rustle nor whisper down the hillsides to
show where the others had gone 

little toomai stared again and again  the clearing  as he remembered it 
had grown in the night  more trees stood in the middle of it  but the
undergrowth and the jungle grass at the sides had been rolled back 
little toomai stared once more  now he understood the trampling  the
elephants had stamped out more room  had stamped the thick grass and
juicy cane to trash  the trash into slivers  the slivers into tiny
fibers  and the fibers into hard earth 

 wah   said little toomai  and his eyes were very heavy   kala nag  my
lord  let us keep by pudmini and go to petersen sahib s camp  or i shall
drop from thy neck  

the third elephant watched the two go away  snorted  wheeled round  and
took his own path  he may have belonged to some little native king s
establishment  fifty or sixty or a hundred miles away 

two hours later  as petersen sahib was eating early breakfast  his
elephants  who had been double chained that night  began to trumpet  and
pudmini  mired to the shoulders  with kala nag  very footsore  shambled
into the camp  little toomai s face was gray and pinched  and his
hair was full of leaves and drenched with dew  but he tried to salute
petersen sahib  and cried faintly   the dance  the elephant dance  i
have seen it  and  i die   as kala nag sat down  he slid off his neck in
a dead faint 

but  since native children have no nerves worth speaking of  in two
hours he was lying very contentedly in petersen sahib s hammock with
petersen sahib s shooting coat under his head  and a glass of warm milk 
a little brandy  with a dash of quinine  inside of him  and while the
old hairy  scarred hunters of the jungles sat three deep before him 
looking at him as though he were a spirit  he told his tale in short
words  as a child will  and wound up with 

 now  if i lie in one word  send men to see  and they will find that the
elephant folk have trampled down more room in their dance room  and
they will find ten and ten  and many times ten  tracks leading to that
dance room  they made more room with their feet  i have seen it  kala
nag took me  and i saw  also kala nag is very leg weary  

little toomai lay back and slept all through the long afternoon and into
the twilight  and while he slept petersen sahib and machua appa followed
the track of the two elephants for fifteen miles across the hills 
petersen sahib had spent eighteen years in catching elephants  and he
had only once before found such a dance place  machua appa had no need
to look twice at the clearing to see what had been done there  or to
scratch with his toe in the packed  rammed earth 

 the child speaks truth   said he   all this was done last night  and
i have counted seventy tracks crossing the river  see  sahib  where
pudmini s leg iron cut the bark of that tree  yes  she was there too  

they looked at one another and up and down  and they wondered  for the
ways of elephants are beyond the wit of any man  black or white  to
fathom 

 forty years and five   said machua appa   have i followed my lord  the
elephant  but never have i heard that any child of man had seen what
this child has seen  by all the gods of the hills  it is  what can we
say   and he shook his head 

when they got back to camp it was time for the evening meal  petersen
sahib ate alone in his tent  but he gave orders that the camp should
have two sheep and some fowls  as well as a double ration of flour and
rice and salt  for he knew that there would be a feast 

big toomai had come up hotfoot from the camp in the plains to search for
his son and his elephant  and now that he had found them he looked at
them as though he were afraid of them both  and there was a feast by
the blazing campfires in front of the lines of picketed elephants 
and little toomai was the hero of it all  and the big brown elephant
catchers  the trackers and drivers and ropers  and the men who know all
the secrets of breaking the wildest elephants  passed him from one to
the other  and they marked his forehead with blood from the breast of a
newly killed jungle cock  to show that he was a forester  initiated and
free of all the jungles 

and at last  when the flames died down  and the red light of the logs
made the elephants look as though they had been dipped in blood too 
machua appa  the head of all the drivers of all the keddahs  machua
appa  petersen sahib s other self  who had never seen a made road in
forty years  machua appa  who was so great that he had no other name
than machua appa   leaped to his feet  with little toomai held high in
the air above his head  and shouted   listen  my brothers  listen  too 
you my lords in the lines there  for i  machua appa  am speaking  this
little one shall no more be called little toomai  but toomai of the
elephants  as his great grandfather was called before him  what never
man has seen he has seen through the long night  and the favor of the
elephant folk and of the gods of the jungles is with him  he shall
become a great tracker  he shall become greater than i  even i  machua
appa  he shall follow the new trail  and the stale trail  and the mixed
trail  with a clear eye  he shall take no harm in the keddah when he
runs under their bellies to rope the wild tuskers  and if he slips
before the feet of the charging bull elephant  the bull elephant
shall know who he is and shall not crush him  aihai  my lords in the
chains    he whirled up the line of pickets   here is the little one
that has seen your dances in your hidden places   the sight that never
man saw  give him honor  my lords  salaam karo  my children  make your
salute to toomai of the elephants  gunga pershad  ahaa  hira guj  birchi
guj  kuttar guj  ahaa  pudmini   thou hast seen him at the dance  and
thou too  kala nag  my pearl among elephants   ahaa  together  to toomai
of the elephants  barrao  

and at that last wild yell the whole line flung up their trunks till the
tips touched their foreheads  and broke out into the full salute  the
crashing trumpet peal that only the viceroy of india hears  the salaamut
of the keddah 

but it was all for the sake of little toomai  who had seen what never
man had seen before  the dance of the elephants at night and alone in
the heart of the garo hills 




shiv and the grasshopper

      the song that toomai s mother sang to the baby 

     shiv  who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow 
     sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago 
     gave to each his portion  food and toil and fate 
     from the king upon the guddee to the beggar at the gate 
        all things made he  shiva the preserver 
        mahadeo   mahadeo   he made all   
        thorn for the camel  fodder for the kine 
        and mother s heart for sleepy head  o little son of mine 


     wheat he gave to rich folk  millet to the poor 
     broken scraps for holy men that beg from door to door 
     battle to the tiger  carrion to the kite 
     and rags and bones to wicked wolves without the wall at night 
     naught he found too lofty  none he saw too low  
     parbati beside him watched them come and go 
     thought to cheat her husband  turning shiv to jest  
     stole the little grasshopper and hid it in her breast 
        so she tricked him  shiva the preserver 
        mahadeo   mahadeo   turn and see 
        tall are the camels  heavy are the kine 
        but this was least of little things  o little son of mine 

     when the dole was ended  laughingly she said 
      master  of a million mouths  is not one unfed  
     laughing  shiv made answer   all have had their part 
     even he  the little one  hidden  neath thy heart  
     from her breast she plucked it  parbati the thief 
     saw the least of little things gnawed a new grown leaf 
     saw and feared and wondered  making prayer to shiv 
     who hath surely given meat to all that live 
        all things made he  shiva the preserver 
        mahadeo   mahadeo   he made all   
        thorn for the camel  fodder for the kine 
        and mother s heart for sleepy head  o little son of mine 




her majesty s servants

     you can work it out by fractions or by simple rule of three 
     but the way of tweedle dum is not the way of tweedle dee 
     you can twist it  you can turn it  you can plait it till you drop 
     but the way of pilly winky s not the way of winkie pop 

it had been raining heavily for one whole month  raining on a camp
of thirty thousand men and thousands of camels  elephants  horses 
bullocks  and mules all gathered together at a place called rawal pindi 
to be reviewed by the viceroy of india  he was receiving a visit from
the amir of afghanistan  a wild king of a very wild country  the amir
had brought with him for a bodyguard eight hundred men and horses who
had never seen a camp or a locomotive before in their lives  savage
men and savage horses from somewhere at the back of central asia  every
night a mob of these horses would be sure to break their heel ropes and
stampede up and down the camp through the mud in the dark  or the camels
would break loose and run about and fall over the ropes of the tents 
and you can imagine how pleasant that was for men trying to go to sleep 
my tent lay far away from the camel lines  and i thought it was safe 
but one night a man popped his head in and shouted   get out  quick 
they re coming  my tent s gone  

i knew who  they  were  so i put on my boots and waterproof and scuttled
out into the slush  little vixen  my fox terrier  went out through the
other side  and then there was a roaring and a grunting and bubbling 
and i saw the tent cave in  as the pole snapped  and begin to dance
about like a mad ghost  a camel had blundered into it  and wet and angry
as i was  i could not help laughing  then i ran on  because i did not
know how many camels might have got loose  and before long i was out of
sight of the camp  plowing my way through the mud 

at last i fell over the tail end of a gun  and by that knew i was
somewhere near the artillery lines where the cannon were stacked at
night  as i did not want to plowter about any more in the drizzle and
the dark  i put my waterproof over the muzzle of one gun  and made a
sort of wigwam with two or three rammers that i found  and lay along the
tail of another gun  wondering where vixen had got to  and where i might
be 

just as i was getting ready to go to sleep i heard a jingle of harness
and a grunt  and a mule passed me shaking his wet ears  he belonged to
a screw gun battery  for i could hear the rattle of the straps and rings
and chains and things on his saddle pad  the screw guns are tiny little
cannon made in two pieces  that are screwed together when the time comes
to use them  they are taken up mountains  anywhere that a mule can find
a road  and they are very useful for fighting in rocky country 

behind the mule there was a camel  with his big soft feet squelching
and slipping in the mud  and his neck bobbing to and fro like a
strayed hen s  luckily  i knew enough of beast language  not wild beast
language  but camp beast language  of course  from the natives to know
what he was saying 

he must have been the one that flopped into my tent  for he called to
the mule   what shall i do  where shall i go  i have fought with a white
thing that waved  and it took a stick and hit me on the neck    that was
my broken tent pole  and i was very glad to know it    shall we run on  

 oh  it was you   said the mule   you and your friends  that have
been disturbing the camp  all right  you ll be beaten for this in the
morning  but i may as well give you something on account now  

i heard the harness jingle as the mule backed and caught the camel
two kicks in the ribs that rang like a drum   another time   he said 
 you ll know better than to run through a mule battery at night 
shouting `thieves and fire   sit down  and keep your silly neck quiet  

the camel doubled up camel fashion  like a two foot rule  and sat down
whimpering  there was a regular beat of hoofs in the darkness  and a big
troop horse cantered up as steadily as though he were on parade  jumped
a gun tail  and landed close to the mule 

 it s disgraceful   he said  blowing out his nostrils   those camels
have racketed through our lines again  the third time this week  how s a
horse to keep his condition if he isn t allowed to sleep  who s here  

 i m the breech piece mule of number two gun of the first screw
battery   said the mule   and the other s one of your friends  he s
waked me up too  who are you  

 number fifteen  e troop  ninth lancers  dick cunliffe s horse  stand
over a little  there  

 oh  beg your pardon   said the mule   it s too dark to see much  aren t
these camels too sickening for anything  i walked out of my lines to get
a little peace and quiet here  

 my lords   said the camel humbly   we dreamed bad dreams in the night 
and we were very much afraid  i am only a baggage camel of the   th
native infantry  and i am not as brave as you are  my lords  

 then why didn t you stay and carry baggage for the   th native
infantry  instead of running all round the camp   said the mule 

 they were such very bad dreams   said the camel   i am sorry  listen 
what is that  shall we run on again  

 sit down   said the mule   or you ll snap your long stick legs between
the guns   he cocked one ear and listened   bullocks   he said   gun
bullocks  on my word  you and your friends have waked the camp very
thoroughly  it takes a good deal of prodding to put up a gun bullock  

i heard a chain dragging along the ground  and a yoke of the great sulky
white bullocks that drag the heavy siege guns when the elephants won t
go any nearer to the firing  came shouldering along together  and almost
stepping on the chain was another battery mule  calling wildly for
 billy  

 that s one of our recruits   said the old mule to the troop horse 
 he s calling for me  here  youngster  stop squealing  the dark never
hurt anybody yet  

the gun bullocks lay down together and began chewing the cud  but the
young mule huddled close to billy 

 things   he said   fearful and horrible  billy  they came into our
lines while we were asleep  d you think they ll kill us  

 i ve a very great mind to give you a number one kicking   said billy 
 the idea of a fourteen hand mule with your training disgracing the
battery before this gentleman  

 gently  gently   said the troop horse   remember they are always like
this to begin with  the first time i ever saw a man  it was in australia
when i was a three year old  i ran for half a day  and if i d seen a
camel  i should have been running still  

nearly all our horses for the english cavalry are brought to india from
australia  and are broken in by the troopers themselves 

 true enough   said billy   stop shaking  youngster  the first time
they put the full harness with all its chains on my back i stood on
my forelegs and kicked every bit of it off  i hadn t learned the real
science of kicking then  but the battery said they had never seen
anything like it  

 but this wasn t harness or anything that jingled   said the young mule 
 you know i don t mind that now  billy  it was things like trees  and
they fell up and down the lines and bubbled  and my head rope broke  and
i couldn t find my driver  and i couldn t find you  billy  so i ran off
with  with these gentlemen  

 h m   said billy   as soon as i heard the camels were loose i came away
on my own account  when a battery  a screw gun mule calls gun bullocks
gentlemen  he must be very badly shaken up  who are you fellows on the
ground there  

the gun bullocks rolled their cuds  and answered both together   the
seventh yoke of the first gun of the big gun battery  we were asleep
when the camels came  but when we were trampled on we got up and walked
away  it is better to lie quiet in the mud than to be disturbed on good
bedding  we told your friend here that there was nothing to be afraid
of  but he knew so much that he thought otherwise  wah  

they went on chewing 

 that comes of being afraid   said billy   you get laughed at by
gun bullocks  i hope you like it  young un  

the young mule s teeth snapped  and i heard him say something about not
being afraid of any beefy old bullock in the world  but the bullocks
only clicked their horns together and went on chewing 

 now  don t be angry after you ve been afraid  that s the worst kind
of cowardice   said the troop horse   anybody can be forgiven for being
scared in the night  i think  if they see things they don t understand 
we ve broken out of our pickets  again and again  four hundred and fifty
of us  just because a new recruit got to telling tales of whip snakes at
home in australia till we were scared to death of the loose ends of our
head ropes  

 that s all very well in camp   said billy   i m not above stampeding
myself  for the fun of the thing  when i haven t been out for a day or
two  but what do you do on active service  

 oh  that s quite another set of new shoes   said the troop horse   dick
cunliffe s on my back then  and drives his knees into me  and all i have
to do is to watch where i am putting my feet  and to keep my hind legs
well under me  and be bridle wise  

 what s bridle wise   said the young mule 

 by the blue gums of the back blocks   snorted the troop horse   do you
mean to say that you aren t taught to be bridle wise in your business 
how can you do anything  unless you can spin round at once when the
rein is pressed on your neck  it means life or death to your man  and of
course that s life and death to you  get round with your hind legs under
you the instant you feel the rein on your neck  if you haven t room to
swing round  rear up a little and come round on your hind legs  that s
being bridle wise  

 we aren t taught that way   said billy the mule stiffly   we re taught
to obey the man at our head  step off when he says so  and step in when
he says so  i suppose it comes to the same thing  now  with all this
fine fancy business and rearing  which must be very bad for your hocks 
what do you do  

 that depends   said the troop horse   generally i have to go in among a
lot of yelling  hairy men with knives  long shiny knives  worse than
the farrier s knives  and i have to take care that dick s boot is just
touching the next man s boot without crushing it  i can see dick s lance
to the right of my right eye  and i know i m safe  i shouldn t care to
be the man or horse that stood up to dick and me when we re in a hurry  

 don t the knives hurt   said the young mule 

 well  i got one cut across the chest once  but that wasn t dick s
fault   

 a lot i should have cared whose fault it was  if it hurt   said the
young mule 

 you must   said the troop horse   if you don t trust your man  you may
as well run away at once  that s what some of our horses do  and i don t
blame them  as i was saying  it wasn t dick s fault  the man was lying
on the ground  and i stretched myself not to tread on him  and he
slashed up at me  next time i have to go over a man lying down i shall
step on him  hard  

 h m   said billy   it sounds very foolish  knives are dirty things
at any time  the proper thing to do is to climb up a mountain with a
well balanced saddle  hang on by all four feet and your ears too  and
creep and crawl and wriggle along  till you come out hundreds of feet
above anyone else on a ledge where there s just room enough for your
hoofs  then you stand still and keep quiet  never ask a man to hold your
head  young un  keep quiet while the guns are being put together  and
then you watch the little poppy shells drop down into the tree tops ever
so far below  

 don t you ever trip   said the troop horse 

 they say that when a mule trips you can split a hen s ear   said billy 
 now and again perhaps a badly packed saddle will upset a mule  but it s
very seldom  i wish i could show you our business  it s beautiful  why 
it took me three years to find out what the men were driving at  the
science of the thing is never to show up against the sky line  because 
if you do  you may get fired at  remember that  young un  always keep
hidden as much as possible  even if you have to go a mile out of your
way  i lead the battery when it comes to that sort of climbing  

 fired at without the chance of running into the people who are firing  
said the troop horse  thinking hard   i couldn t stand that  i should
want to charge  with dick  

 oh  no  you wouldn t  you know that as soon as the guns are in
position they ll do all the charging  that s scientific and neat  but
knives  pah  

the baggage camel had been bobbing his head to and fro for some time
past  anxious to get a word in edgewise  then i heard him say  as he
cleared his throat  nervously 

 i  i  i have fought a little  but not in that climbing way or that
running way  

 no  now you mention it   said billy   you don t look as though you were
made for climbing or running  much  well  how was it  old hay bales  

 the proper way   said the camel   we all sat down   

 oh  my crupper and breastplate   said the troop horse under his breath 
 sat down  

 we sat down  a hundred of us   the camel went on   in a big square  and
the men piled our packs and saddles  outside the square  and they fired
over our backs  the men did  on all sides of the square  

 what sort of men  any men that came along   said the troop horse   they
teach us in riding school to lie down and let our masters fire across
us  but dick cunliffe is the only man i d trust to do that  it tickles
my girths  and  besides  i can t see with my head on the ground  

 what does it matter who fires across you   said the camel   there are
plenty of men and plenty of other camels close by  and a great many
clouds of smoke  i am not frightened then  i sit still and wait  

 and yet   said billy   you dream bad dreams and upset the camp at
night  well  well  before i d lie down  not to speak of sitting down 
and let a man fire across me  my heels and his head would have something
to say to each other  did you ever hear anything so awful as that  

there was a long silence  and then one of the gun bullocks lifted up his
big head and said   this is very foolish indeed  there is only one way
of fighting  

 oh  go on   said billy   please don t mind me  i suppose you fellows
fight standing on your tails  

 only one way   said the two together   they must have been twins  
 this is that way  to put all twenty yoke of us to the big gun as soon
as two tails trumpets     two tails  is camp slang for the elephant  

 what does two tails trumpet for   said the young mule 

 to show that he is not going any nearer to the smoke on the other
side  two tails is a great coward  then we tug the big gun all
together  heya  hullah  heeyah  hullah  we do not climb like cats nor
run like calves  we go across the level plain  twenty yoke of us  till
we are unyoked again  and we graze while the big guns talk across the
plain to some town with mud walls  and pieces of the wall fall out  and
the dust goes up as though many cattle were coming home  

 oh  and you choose that time for grazing   said the young mule 

 that time or any other  eating is always good  we eat till we are yoked
up again and tug the gun back to where two tails is waiting for it 
sometimes there are big guns in the city that speak back  and some of
us are killed  and then there is all the more grazing for those that are
left  this is fate  none the less  two tails is a great coward  that is
the proper way to fight  we are brothers from hapur  our father was a
sacred bull of shiva  we have spoken  

 well  i ve certainly learned something tonight   said the troop horse 
 do you gentlemen of the screw gun battery feel inclined to eat when you
are being fired at with big guns  and two tails is behind you  

 about as much as we feel inclined to sit down and let men sprawl all
over us  or run into people with knives  i never heard such stuff  a
mountain ledge  a well balanced load  a driver you can trust to let you
pick your own way  and i m your mule  but  the other things  no   said
billy  with a stamp of his foot 

 of course   said the troop horse   everyone is not made in the same
way  and i can quite see that your family  on your father s side  would
fail to understand a great many things  

 never you mind my family on my father s side   said billy angrily  for
every mule hates to be reminded that his father was a donkey   my father
was a southern gentleman  and he could pull down and bite and kick into
rags every horse he came across  remember that  you big brown brumby  

brumby means wild horse without any breeding  imagine the feelings of
sunol if a car horse called her a  skate   and you can imagine how the
australian horse felt  i saw the white of his eye glitter in the dark 

 see here  you son of an imported malaga jackass   he said between
his teeth   i d have you know that i m related on my mother s side to
carbine  winner of the melbourne cup  and where i come from we aren t
accustomed to being ridden over roughshod by any parrot mouthed 
pig headed mule in a pop gun pea shooter battery  are you ready  

 on your hind legs   squealed billy  they both reared up facing each
other  and i was expecting a furious fight  when a gurgly  rumbly
voice  called out of the darkness to the right   children  what are you
fighting about there  be quiet  

both beasts dropped down with a snort of disgust  for neither horse nor
mule can bear to listen to an elephant s voice 

 it s two tails   said the troop horse   i can t stand him  a tail at
each end isn t fair  

 my feelings exactly   said billy  crowding into the troop horse for
company   we re very alike in some things  

 i suppose we ve inherited them from our mothers   said the troop horse 
 it s not worth quarreling about  hi  two tails  are you tied up  

 yes   said two tails  with a laugh all up his trunk   i m picketed for
the night  i ve heard what you fellows have been saying  but don t be
afraid  i m not coming over  

the bullocks and the camel said  half aloud   afraid of two tails  what
nonsense   and the bullocks went on   we are sorry that you heard  but
it is true  two tails  why are you afraid of the guns when they fire  

 well   said two tails  rubbing one hind leg against the other  exactly
like a little boy saying a poem   i don t quite know whether you d
understand  

 we don t  but we have to pull the guns   said the bullocks 

 i know it  and i know you are a good deal braver than you think
you are  but it s different with me  my battery captain called me a
pachydermatous anachronism the other day  

 that s another way of fighting  i suppose   said billy  who was
recovering his spirits 

 you don t know what that means  of course  but i do  it means betwixt
and between  and that is just where i am  i can see inside my head what
will happen when a shell bursts  and you bullocks can t  

 i can   said the troop horse   at least a little bit  i try not to
think about it  

 i can see more than you  and i do think about it  i know there s a
great deal of me to take care of  and i know that nobody knows how to
cure me when i m sick  all they can do is to stop my driver s pay till i
get well  and i can t trust my driver  

 ah   said the troop horse   that explains it  i can trust dick  

 you could put a whole regiment of dicks on my back without making me
feel any better  i know just enough to be uncomfortable  and not enough
to go on in spite of it  

 we do not understand   said the bullocks 

 i know you don t  i m not talking to you  you don t know what blood
is  

 we do   said the bullocks   it is red stuff that soaks into the ground
and smells  

the troop horse gave a kick and a bound and a snort 

 don t talk of it   he said   i can smell it now  just thinking of it 
it makes me want to run  when i haven t dick on my back  

 but it is not here   said the camel and the bullocks   why are you so
stupid  

 it s vile stuff   said billy   i don t want to run  but i don t want to
talk about it  

 there you are   said two tails  waving his tail to explain 

 surely  yes  we have been here all night   said the bullocks 

two tails stamped his foot till the iron ring on it jingled   oh  i m
not talking to you  you can t see inside your heads  

 no  we see out of our four eyes   said the bullocks   we see straight
in front of us  

 if i could do that and nothing else  you wouldn t be needed to pull the
big guns at all  if i was like my captain  he can see things inside his
head before the firing begins  and he shakes all over  but he knows too
much to run away  if i was like him i could pull the guns  but if i were
as wise as all that i should never be here  i should be a king in the
forest  as i used to be  sleeping half the day and bathing when i liked 
i haven t had a good bath for a month  

 that s all very fine   said billy   but giving a thing a long name
doesn t make it any better  

 h sh   said the troop horse   i think i understand what two tails
means  

 you ll understand better in a minute   said two tails angrily   now you
just explain to me why you don t like this  

he began trumpeting furiously at the top of his trumpet 

 stop that   said billy and the troop horse together  and i could
hear them stamp and shiver  an elephant s trumpeting is always nasty 
especially on a dark night 

 i shan t stop   said two tails   won t you explain that  please 
hhrrmph  rrrt  rrrmph  rrrhha   then he stopped suddenly  and i heard
a little whimper in the dark  and knew that vixen had found me at last 
she knew as well as i did that if there is one thing in the world the
elephant is more afraid of than another it is a little barking dog  so
she stopped to bully two tails in his pickets  and yapped round his big
feet  two tails shuffled and squeaked   go away  little dog   he said 
 don t snuff at my ankles  or i ll kick at you  good little dog  nice
little doggie  then  go home  you yelping little beast  oh  why doesn t
someone take her away  she ll bite me in a minute  

 seems to me   said billy to the troop horse   that our friend two tails
is afraid of most things  now  if i had a full meal for every dog i ve
kicked across the parade ground i should be as fat as two tails nearly  

i whistled  and vixen ran up to me  muddy all over  and licked my nose 
and told me a long tale about hunting for me all through the camp  i
never let her know that i understood beast talk  or she would have
taken all sorts of liberties  so i buttoned her into the breast of my
overcoat  and two tails shuffled and stamped and growled to himself 

 extraordinary  most extraordinary   he said   it runs in our family 
now  where has that nasty little beast gone to  

i heard him feeling about with his trunk 

 we all seem to be affected in various ways   he went on  blowing his
nose   now  you gentlemen were alarmed  i believe  when i trumpeted  

 not alarmed  exactly   said the troop horse   but it made me feel as
though i had hornets where my saddle ought to be  don t begin again  

 i m frightened of a little dog  and the camel here is frightened by bad
dreams in the night  

 it is very lucky for us that we haven t all got to fight in the same
way   said the troop horse 

 what i want to know   said the young mule  who had been quiet for a
long time   what i want to know is  why we have to fight at all  

 because we re told to   said the troop horse  with a snort of contempt 

 orders   said billy the mule  and his teeth snapped 

 hukm hai    it is an order    said the camel with a gurgle  and two
tails and the bullocks repeated   hukm hai  

 yes  but who gives the orders   said the recruit mule 

 the man who walks at your head  or sits on your back  or holds the nose
rope  or twists your tail   said billy and the troop horse and the camel
and the bullocks one after the other 

 but who gives them the orders  

 now you want to know too much  young un   said billy   and that is one
way of getting kicked  all you have to do is to obey the man at your
head and ask no questions  

 he s quite right   said two tails   i can t always obey  because i m
betwixt and between  but billy s right  obey the man next to you who
gives the order  or you ll stop all the battery  besides getting a
thrashing  

the gun bullocks got up to go   morning is coming   they said   we will
go back to our lines  it is true that we only see out of our eyes  and
we are not very clever  but still  we are the only people to night who
have not been afraid  good night  you brave people  

nobody answered  and the troop horse said  to change the conversation 
 where s that little dog  a dog means a man somewhere about  

 here i am   yapped vixen   under the gun tail with my man  you big 
blundering beast of a camel you  you upset our tent  my man s very
angry  

 phew   said the bullocks   he must be white  

 of course he is   said vixen   do you suppose i m looked after by a
black bullock driver  

 huah  ouach  ugh   said the bullocks   let us get away quickly  

they plunged forward in the mud  and managed somehow to run their yoke
on the pole of an ammunition wagon  where it jammed 

 now you have done it   said billy calmly   don t struggle  you re hung
up till daylight  what on earth s the matter  

the bullocks went off into the long hissing snorts that indian cattle
give  and pushed and crowded and slued and stamped and slipped and
nearly fell down in the mud  grunting savagely 

 you ll break your necks in a minute   said the troop horse   what s the
matter with white men  i live with  em  

 they  eat  us  pull   said the near bullock  the yoke snapped with a
twang  and they lumbered off together 

i never knew before what made indian cattle so scared of englishmen 
we eat beef  a thing that no cattle driver touches  and of course the
cattle do not like it 

 may i be flogged with my own pad chains  who d have thought of two big
lumps like those losing their heads   said billy 

 never mind  i m going to look at this man  most of the white men  i
know  have things in their pockets   said the troop horse 

 i ll leave you  then  i can t say i m over fond of  em myself  besides 
white men who haven t a place to sleep in are more than likely to be
thieves  and i ve a good deal of government property on my back  come
along  young un  and we ll go back to our lines  good night  australia 
see you on parade to morrow  i suppose  good night  old hay bale   try
to control your feelings  won t you  good night  two tails  if you pass
us on the ground tomorrow  don t trumpet  it spoils our formation  

billy the mule stumped off with the swaggering limp of an old
campaigner  as the troop horse s head came nuzzling into my breast  and
i gave him biscuits  while vixen  who is a most conceited little dog 
told him fibs about the scores of horses that she and i kept 

 i m coming to the parade to morrow in my dog cart   she said   where
will you be  

 on the left hand of the second squadron  i set the time for all my
troop  little lady   he said politely   now i must go back to dick  my
tail s all muddy  and he ll have two hours  hard work dressing me for
parade  

the big parade of all the thirty thousand men was held that afternoon 
and vixen and i had a good place close to the viceroy and the amir of
afghanistan  with high  big black hat of astrakhan wool and the great
diamond star in the center  the first part of the review was all
sunshine  and the regiments went by in wave upon wave of legs all moving
together  and guns all in a line  till our eyes grew dizzy  then the
cavalry came up  to the beautiful cavalry canter of  bonnie dundee   and
vixen cocked her ear where she sat on the dog cart  the second squadron
of the lancers shot by  and there was the troop horse  with his tail
like spun silk  his head pulled into his breast  one ear forward and one
back  setting the time for all his squadron  his legs going as smoothly
as waltz music  then the big guns came by  and i saw two tails and two
other elephants harnessed in line to a forty pounder siege gun  while
twenty yoke of oxen walked behind  the seventh pair had a new yoke  and
they looked rather stiff and tired  last came the screw guns  and billy
the mule carried himself as though he commanded all the troops  and his
harness was oiled and polished till it winked  i gave a cheer all by
myself for billy the mule  but he never looked right or left 

the rain began to fall again  and for a while it was too misty to see
what the troops were doing  they had made a big half circle across the
plain  and were spreading out into a line  that line grew and grew and
grew till it was three quarters of a mile long from wing to wing  one
solid wall of men  horses  and guns  then it came on straight toward the
viceroy and the amir  and as it got nearer the ground began to shake 
like the deck of a steamer when the engines are going fast 

unless you have been there you cannot imagine what a frightening effect
this steady come down of troops has on the spectators  even when they
know it is only a review  i looked at the amir  up till then he had not
shown the shadow of a sign of astonishment or anything else  but now his
eyes began to get bigger and bigger  and he picked up the reins on his
horse s neck and looked behind him  for a minute it seemed as though he
were going to draw his sword and slash his way out through the english
men and women in the carriages at the back  then the advance stopped
dead  the ground stood still  the whole line saluted  and thirty bands
began to play all together  that was the end of the review  and the
regiments went off to their camps in the rain  and an infantry band
struck up with  

     the animals went in two by two 
          hurrah 
     the animals went in two by two 
     the elephant and the battery mul  
     and they all got into the ark
          for to get out of the rain 

then i heard an old grizzled  long haired central asian chief  who had
come down with the amir  asking questions of a native officer 

 now   said he   in what manner was this wonderful thing done  

and the officer answered   an order was given  and they obeyed  

 but are the beasts as wise as the men   said the chief 

 they obey  as the men do  mule  horse  elephant  or bullock  he
obeys his driver  and the driver his sergeant  and the sergeant his
lieutenant  and the lieutenant his captain  and the captain his major 
and the major his colonel  and the colonel his brigadier commanding
three regiments  and the brigadier the general  who obeys the viceroy 
who is the servant of the empress  thus it is done  

 would it were so in afghanistan   said the chief   for there we obey
only our own wills  

 and for that reason   said the native officer  twirling his mustache 
 your amir whom you do not obey must come here and take orders from our
viceroy  




parade song of the camp animals

     elephants of the gun teams

     we lent to alexander the strength of hercules 
     the wisdom of our foreheads  the cunning of our knees 
     we bowed our necks to service  they ne er were loosed again   
     make way there  way for the ten foot teams
           of the forty pounder train 

     gun bullocks

     those heroes in their harnesses avoid a cannon ball 
     and what they know of powder upsets them one and all 
     then we come into action and tug the guns again  
     make way there  way for the twenty yoke
           of the forty pounder train 

     cavalry horses

     by the brand on my shoulder  the finest of tunes
     is played by the lancers  hussars  and dragoons 
     and it s sweeter than  stables  or  water  to me  
     the cavalry canter of  bonnie dundee  

     then feed us and break us and handle and groom 
     and give us good riders and plenty of room 
     and launch us in column of squadron and see
     the way of the war horse to  bonnie dundee  

     screw gun mules

     as me and my companions were scrambling up a hill 
     the path was lost in rolling stones  but we went forward still 
     for we can wriggle and climb  my lads  and turn up everywhere 
     oh  it s our delight on a mountain height  with a leg or two to
        spare 

     good luck to every sergeant  then  that lets us pick our road 
     bad luck to all the driver men that cannot pack a load 
     for we can wriggle and climb  my lads  and turn up everywhere 
     oh  it s our delight on a mountain height  with a leg or two to
        spare 

     commissariat camels

     we haven t a camelty tune of our own
     to help us trollop along 
     but every neck is a hair trombone
      rtt ta ta ta  is a hair trombone  
     and this our marching song 
     can t   don t   shan t   won t 
     pass it along the line 
     somebody s pack has slid from his back 
     wish it were only mine 
     somebody s load has tipped off in the road  
     cheer for a halt and a row 
     urrr   yarrh   grr   arrh 
     somebody s catching it now 

     all the beasts together

     children of the camp are we 
     serving each in his degree 
     children of the yoke and goad 
     pack and harness  pad and load 
     see our line across the plain 
     like a heel rope bent again 
     reaching  writhing  rolling far 
     sweeping all away to war 
     while the men that walk beside 
     dusty  silent  heavy eyed 
     cannot tell why we or they
     march and suffer day by day 
        children of the camp are we 
        serving each in his degree 
        children of the yoke and goad 
        pack and harness  pad and load
